Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nSet disabled prop on ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently the django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm defines a clean_password method that returns the initial password value to prevent (accidental) changes to the password value. It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example\nA while ago the forms.Field base class gained the \u200bdisabled argument to:\n[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won\u2019t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field\u2019s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form\u2019s initial data.\nIt seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n"}], "role": "user"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-ApPIp9RYeUnVEK4hCEFXU7JerXEdb", "created": 1736815355, "model": "o1-2024-12-17", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6675b66d18", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"view\",\"path\":\"/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/contrib/auth/forms.py\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "call_2LsjX2vBPB9AQ1T14Y1MbQif", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 877, "prompt_tokens": 1384, "total_tokens": 2261, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 832, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.
