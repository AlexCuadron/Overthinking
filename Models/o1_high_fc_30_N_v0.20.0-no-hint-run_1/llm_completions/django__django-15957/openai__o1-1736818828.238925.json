Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nPrefetch objects don't work with slices\nDescription\n\t\n\u200bPrefetch() objects does not work with sliced querysets. For example the following code results in AssertionError: Cannot filter a query once a slice has been taken.:\nCategory.objects.prefetch_related(Prefetch(\n\t'post_set',\n\tqueryset=Post.objects.all()[:3],\n\tto_attr='example_posts',\n))\nThis behavior is also mentioned in \u200bthis StackOverflow answer. On the other hand it does not seem to be documented in Django Docs.\nWhy is it needed?\nMy use case seems to be a common one: I want to display a list of categories while displaying couple of example objects from each category next to it. If I'm not mistaken there isn't currently an efficient way of doing this. Prefetching without slicing would prefetch all objects (and there may be thousands of them) instead of the three examples that are needed.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n"}], "role": "user"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_1XTeuTzBBIvhuv3AIF1LLyi4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"ls -l /workspace/django__django__4.2\"}"}}]}, {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "total 136\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root 40718 Jan 14 01:38 AUTHORS\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root  1115 Jan 14 01:38 CONTRIBUTING.rst\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Jan 14 01:38 Django.egg-info\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   369 Jan 14 01:38 Gruntfile.js\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   236 Jan 14 01:38 INSTALL\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root  1552 Jan 14 01:38 LICENSE\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root 14383 Jan 14 01:38 LICENSE.python\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   276 Jan 14 01:38 MANIFEST.in\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root  2122 Jan 14 01:38 README.rst\ndrwxr-xr-x  18 root root  4096 Jan 14 01:38 django\ndrwxr-xr-x  13 root root  4096 Jan 14 01:38 docs\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Jan 14 01:38 extras\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root root  4096 Jan 14 01:38 js_tests\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   363 Jan 14 01:38 package.json\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root   219 Jan 14 01:38 pyproject.toml\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Jan 14 01:38 scripts\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root  2276 Jan 14 01:38 setup.cfg\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root  1633 Jan 14 01:38 setup.py\ndrwxr-xr-x 215 root root 12288 Jan 14 01:38 tests\n-rw-r--r--   1 root root  1702 Jan 14 01:38 tox.ini\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}], "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_1XTeuTzBBIvhuv3AIF1LLyi4", "name": "execute_bash"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-ApQCBrpgUmd1H1smxdvzIZIx9umru", "created": 1736818787, "model": "o1-2024-12-17", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_d91c966719", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"ls -R /workspace/django__django__4.2/django\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "call_WfA4owpzWs8E2C5IA5d0Gjg2", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 3689, "prompt_tokens": 1917, "total_tokens": 5606, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 3648, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished.
