Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nlatex() and mul_symbol\nThe `latex()` pretty-printing function accepts a `mul_symbol` kwarg that must be one of four choices. I would like to be able to supply my own choice which is not in the list. Specifically, I want the multiplication symbol to be `\\,` (i.e., a thin space). This is what I mean\r\n```\r\n>>> latex(3*x**2*y)\r\n'3 \\\\, x^{2} \\\\, y' # I typed the thin spaces in after the fact\r\n```\r\n\r\nThin spaces are used by sympy to separate differentials from integrands in integrals.\r\n```\r\n>>> latex(Integral(2*x**2*y, x))\r\n'\\\\int 2 x^{2} y\\\\, dx' # This thin space is sympy's current behavior\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a reason why the user cannot supply the `mul_symbol` of their choosing? Or are the 4 choices a historical artifact? I'm willing to attempt making a PR to allow `mul_symbol` to be arbitrary (and backwards-compatible) if such a PR would be considered.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n"}], "role": "user"}, {"content": [], "role": "assistant",
