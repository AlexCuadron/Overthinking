Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nInherited classes not correctly documented when mocked\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe're experiencing an issue when documenting classes that inherit mocked classes. However, classes which inherit other classes from our own package are ok.\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to be dependent on the `sphinx` version:\r\n\r\n- `sphinx<3.0`: Everything is OK. \r\n- `sphinx>=3.0 < 3.4.2`: Classes that inherit mocked classes are not documented. (see [sphinx #8164](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/8164)). This is fixed in `sphinx 3.4.2`. \r\n- `sphinx>=3.4.2`: The previously missing classes are now documented, but there is a problem with the \"Bases\" section in the docs. \r\n \r\nExample: In the docs for `alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.DeepKernel` in this readthedocs build https://seldon--338.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/338/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html, the base class is listed as \"Bases: `torch.nn.`\" instead of \"Bases: `torch.nn.Module`\". \r\n\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ascillitoe/alibi-detect.git\r\n$ cd alibi-detect\r\n$ pip install -r requirements/docs.txt\r\n$ make build_docs\r\n$ # open doc/_build/html/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html and see \"Bases\" section.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe \"Bases\" section should report `torch.nn.Module` not `torch.nn.`. \r\n\r\ni.e. see\r\nhttps://seldon--325.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/325/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html\r\n\r\n### Your project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ascillitoe/alibi-detect/tree/feature_sphinx4\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Screenshot with `sphinx==4.2`\r\n![sphinx_problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061685/133816582-ca162b07-41c7-4b8e-98ea-781e7c659229.png)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot with `sphinx<3.0`\r\n![sphinx_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061685/133816065-6291ce1b-96cf-4b0f-9648-7f993fc15611.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04 (used by readthedocs/build:6.0)\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.8.11\r\n\r\n### Sphinx version\r\n\r\n`>=3.4.2`\r\n\r\n### Sphinx extensions\r\n\r\n    [\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.doctest\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.intersphinx\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.todo\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.coverage\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.mathjax\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.ifconfig\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.viewcode\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.napoleon\",\r\n    \"sphinx_autodoc_typehints\",\r\n    \"sphinxcontrib.apidoc\", \r\n    \"nbsphinx\",\r\n    \"nbsphinx_link\",  \r\n    \"myst_parser\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra tools\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\ndemo PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect/pull/338\r\n\r\nreadthedocs demo build:\r\nhttps://seldon--338.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/338/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html\r\n\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.
