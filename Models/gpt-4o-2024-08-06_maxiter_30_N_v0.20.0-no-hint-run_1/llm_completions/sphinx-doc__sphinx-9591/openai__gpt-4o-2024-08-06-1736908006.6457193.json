As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.
