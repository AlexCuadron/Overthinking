Let me try to understand the problem and figure out what changes are needed.\n\nFirst, the user provided an issue description. They're creating a BlockMatrix with some ZeroMatrix blocks and then trying to multiply it by itself. It works once, but when they try to multiply it again, they get an error. The error is an AttributeError because a 'Zero' object doesn't have 'cols' attribute. Hmm, that's odd because ZeroMatrix should have the necessary attributes.\n\nLooking at the error trace, it seems that during the multiplication, the code is trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a Zero object, which doesn't exist. That suggests that somewhere, instead of a ZeroMatrix, a regular Zero value is being used, which doesn't have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nIn the user's example, when they do b._blockmul(b), the result has ZeroMatrix blocks, but when they try to multiply again, it's somehow turning into Zero objects instead of ZeroMatrix. So maybe the issue is that the BlockMatrix multiplication isn't correctly handling cases where the blocks are ZeroMatrix instances.\n\nI remember that in SymPy, ZeroMatrix is a specific class that has the 'cols' and 'rows' attributes. If during the multiplication process, the code is treating Zero as a scalar (which it's not), it would cause this error. So perhaps the problem lies in how the BlockMatrix multiplication is handling the blocks, especially when they are ZeroMatrix.\n\nI should check the relevant SymPy code, specifically the BlockMatrix multiplication methods. Maybe the _blockmul method isn't correctly checking if a block is a ZeroMatrix and is treating it as a regular Zero, leading to the AttributeError.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when the BlockMatrix is multiplying, it correctly handles ZeroMatrix blocks. Perhaps in the _blockmul method, when constructing the resulting blocks, it should check if a block is a ZeroMatrix and handle it appropriately, maybe by returning a ZeroMatrix instead of a regular Zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is in how the blocks are being processed. For example, when a block is a ZeroMatrix, its 'cols' attribute should be accessible, but if for some reason it's being converted to a scalar, that would cause the error.\n\nI should look into the BlockMatrix code, particularly the _blockmul method. I need to find where the multiplication is happening and ensure that it correctly handles ZeroMatrix instances. Maybe adding a condition to check if a block is a ZeroMatrix and then using its dimensions correctly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the way the blocks are being accessed or created during multiplication is incorrect. For example, if the code is treating a ZeroMatrix as a scalar, it would lose the 'cols' information. So, perhaps the code needs to be modified to ensure that ZeroMatrix objects are treated as matrices, not scalars.\n\nI might also consider that the user is using an older version of SymPy (1.4) which might have known issues with handling ZeroMatrix in BlockMatrix operations. Updating to a newer version could resolve this, but since the user is using pip, maybe a patch or specific fix is needed.\n\nIn any case, the key is to modify the BlockMatrix multiplication logic to correctly handle ZeroMatrix blocks. This might involve checking the type of each block during multiplication and ensuring that the dimensions are correctly retrieved from the ZeroMatrix instances.\n\nAfter making these changes, the user should test the multiplication again to see if the error is resolved. If the fix works, the multiplication should handle the ZeroMatrix blocks properly without causing an AttributeError.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve the issue where multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks results in an AttributeError, we need to ensure that the BlockMatrix multiplication correctly handles ZeroMatrix instances. The error occurs because the code expects the 'cols' attribute to exist on a Zero object, but ZeroMatrix provides this attribute.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Modify the BlockMatrix Multiplication Logic**: Update the `_blockmul` method in the BlockMatrix class to properly handle ZeroMatrix blocks. Specifically, ensure that when accessing block dimensions, ZeroMatrix objects are treated as matrices with appropriate dimensions.\n\n2. **Ensure ZeroMatrix Instances Are Used**: Verify that during multiplication, ZeroMatrix instances are used instead of regular Zero values.

Let me try to understand the problem and figure out what changes are needed.\n\nFirst, the user provided an issue description. They're creating a BlockMatrix with some ZeroMatrix blocks and then trying to multiply it by itself. It works once, but when they try to multiply it again, they get an error. The error is an AttributeError because a 'Zero' object doesn't have 'cols' attribute. Hmm, that's odd because ZeroMatrix should have the necessary attributes.\n\nLooking at the error trace, it seems that during the multiplication, the code is trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a Zero object, which doesn't exist. That suggests that somewhere, instead of a ZeroMatrix, a regular Zero value is being used, which doesn't have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nIn the user's example, when they do b._blockmul(b), the result has ZeroMatrix blocks, but when they try to multiply again, it's somehow turning into Zero objects instead of ZeroMatrix. So maybe the issue is that the BlockMatrix multiplication isn't correctly handling cases where the blocks are ZeroMatrix instances.\n\nI remember that in SymPy, ZeroMatrix is a specific class that has the 'cols' and 'rows' attributes. If during the multiplication process, the code is treating Zero as a scalar (which it's not), it would cause this error. So perhaps the problem lies in how the BlockMatrix multiplication is handling the blocks, especially when they are ZeroMatrix.\n\nI should check the relevant SymPy code, specifically the BlockMatrix multiplication methods. Maybe the _blockmul method isn't correctly checking if a block is a ZeroMatrix and is treating it as a regular Zero, leading to the AttributeError.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when the BlockMatrix is multiplying, it correctly handles ZeroMatrix blocks. Perhaps in the _blockmul method, when constructing the resulting blocks, it should check if a block is a ZeroMatrix and handle it appropriately, maybe by returning a ZeroMatrix instead of a regular Zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is in how the blocks are being processed. For example, when a block is a ZeroMatrix, its 'cols' attribute should be accessible, but if for some reason it's being converted to a scalar, that would cause the error.\n\nI should look into the BlockMatrix code, particularly the _blockmul method. I need to find where the multiplication is happening and ensure that it correctly handles ZeroMatrix instances. Maybe adding a condition to check if a block is a ZeroMatrix and then using its dimensions correctly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the way the blocks are being accessed or created during multiplication is incorrect. For example, if the code is treating a ZeroMatrix as a scalar, it would lose the 'cols' information. So, perhaps the code needs to be modified to ensure that ZeroMatrix objects are treated as matrices, not scalars.\n\nI might also consider that the user is using an older version of SymPy (1.4) which might have known issues with handling ZeroMatrix in BlockMatrix operations. Updating to a newer version could resolve this, but since the user is using pip, maybe a patch or specific fix is needed.\n\nIn any case, the key is to modify the BlockMatrix multiplication logic to correctly handle ZeroMatrix blocks. This might involve checking the type of each block during multiplication and ensuring that the dimensions are correctly retrieved from the ZeroMatrix instances.\n\nAfter making these changes, the user should test the multiplication again to see if the error is resolved. If the fix works, the multiplication should handle the ZeroMatrix blocks properly without causing an AttributeError.\n</think>\n\nTo resolve the issue where multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks results in an AttributeError, we need to ensure that the BlockMatrix multiplication correctly handles ZeroMatrix instances. The error occurs because the code expects the 'cols' attribute to exist on a Zero object, but ZeroMatrix provides this attribute.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Modify the BlockMatrix Multiplication Logic**: Update the `_blockmul` method in the BlockMatrix class to properly handle ZeroMatrix blocks. Specifically, ensure that when accessing block dimensions, ZeroMatrix objects are treated as matrices with appropriate dimensions.\n\n2. **Ensure ZeroMatrix Instances Are Used**: Verify that during multiplication, ZeroMatrix instances are used instead of regular Zero values. This ensures that the 'cols' and 'rows' attributes are accessible.\n\n3. **Test the Changes**: After making the modifications, test the multiplication of BlockMatrices containing ZeroMatrix blocks to confirm that the error is resolved and the multiplication works as expected.\n\nHere is the function call to implement the fix:\n\n```python", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.5\", \"file_text\": \"from sympy import *\\na = MatrixSymbol(\\\"a\\\", 2, 2)\\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1053, "prompt_tokens": 4324, "total_tokens": 5377, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
