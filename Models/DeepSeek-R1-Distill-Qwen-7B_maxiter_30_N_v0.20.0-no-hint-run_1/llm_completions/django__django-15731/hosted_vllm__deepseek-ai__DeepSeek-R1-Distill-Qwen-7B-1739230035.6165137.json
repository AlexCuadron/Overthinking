By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run.

The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I need to help the user fix an issue where using inspect.signature() on manager methods returns incorrect information. The problem occurs in Django's models, specifically when using methods like bulk_create. The expected signature includes parameters like objs, batch_size, and ignore_conflicts, but currently, it's returning (*args, **kwargs) instead.\n\nFirst, I should understand why this is happening. Looking at the provided code, the manager.py file has a method for bulk_create. The issue is that when inspect.signature is called on this method, it's not capturing the specific parameters we expect. The user mentioned that using functools.wraps instead of manually setting the name and docstring might fix this because wraps copies the metadata, which includes the signature.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify the method in manager.py to use wraps from functools. This should ensure that all the method's metadata, including its signature, is correctly copied over. \n\nI'll start by importing functools in the manager.py file. Then, I'll decorate the bulk_create method with @functools.wraps. This should replace the manual assignments of __name__ and __doc__ with a proper wraps setup, which handles the signature correctly.\n\nI should also check if there are any other methods that might be affected and ensure they're using wraps as well. But for this specific issue, the focus is on bulk_create.\n\nOnce the changes are made, the user can run their test script to confirm that inspect.signature now returns the expected signature with the correct parameters. This should resolve the issue they're facing.\n</think>\n\nLet me help you fix the issue with the incorrect signature returned by inspect.signature(). We need to modify the manager.py file to properly handle the method metadata.\n\n1. First, let's import functools in manager.py:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.dispatch import dispatch\nimport functools\n```\n\n2.
