This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nFrom the issue description, when a model uses choices like MyChoice, the field's value is returning the enum instance instead of just the string. For example, MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE is an enum, and when accessed, it's still an enum, not a string. This causes test failures because the test expects a string.\n\nThe user mentioned they've already handled the test files, so I don't need to touch those. My focus is on the non-test files in the /workspace directory.\n\nI remember that in Django, when you use choices with enums, the field defaults to storing the enum instance. To make it store the string instead, we need to set the `choices` parameter correctly. But wait, the user's problem is that the value is the enum instance, not the string. So perhaps the model is using the wrong choices.\n\nLooking at the example, the model uses MyChoice.choices, which is a tuple of tuples. The second element is the string. But maybe the model should be using the enum instances as the choices. Alternatively, perhaps the model should be using the `choices` parameter with the enum instances, and then the field will store the string.\n\nWait, no. The `choices` parameter in Django's models should be a list of tuples where the first element is the displayed value, and the second is the enum instance. So when the model is created, it should store the enum instance, but when retrieved, it's converted to the string.\n\nBut the user's test expects the value to be a string. So perhaps the model is not correctly converting the enum to a string when saving, or the field is not being set to store strings.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the model is using the wrong choices. Let me think: if the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, and MyChoice is a TextChoices, then the field will store the string value. But in the user's case, it's storing the enum instance. So perhaps the model is using the wrong choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model is using a different type of choices, like IntegerChoices, which are backed by integers. So when the enum is used, it's not correctly converting to the string.\n\nWait, the issue description says that the value is of the same type as the enum value. So when the user creates an instance, my_object.my_str_value is an enum, not a string. But the test expects it to be a string.\n\nSo to fix this, the model should store the string representation of the enum. One way to do this is to use the `formfield` parameter with `empty_values` to ensure that the value is stored as a string. Alternatively, perhaps the model's field should be defined with `choices` as the string values, not the enum instances.\n\nWait, no. The `choices` parameter in Django's models should be a list of tuples where the first element is the string representation, and the second is the enum instance. So when the model is saved, it stores the enum instance, but when retrieved, it's converted to the string.\n\nBut in the user's case, the field is returning the enum instance, not the string. So perhaps the model is not correctly configured to store the string. Maybe the field is defined without specifying that it should store strings.\n\nWait, perhaps the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, but MyChoice is a TextChoices, so the field should store strings. But in the user's case, it's storing the enum. So maybe the model is using a different type of choices, like IntegerChoices, which are integers, and thus the field is storing integers instead of strings.\n\nWait, the issue says that the value is of the same type as the enum value. So if the enum is an IntegerChoices, the field would store integers. But in the user's case, the field is returning the enum instance, which suggests that the choices are using the enum instances as the second element in the tuples.\n\nSo perhaps the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, where MyChoice is a TextChoices, so the field should store strings. But in the user's case, it's not working as expected.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the model is using the wrong choices. Let me think: if the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, and MyChoice is a TextChoices, then the field should store the string value. But perhaps the model is using a different approach, like using the enum's string representation directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model is using the `formfield` parameter with `empty_values` to ensure that the value is a string. For example, using `formfield__empty_values__values__type='str'`.\n\nWait, but in Django, the `choices` parameter already determines how the value is stored. So if the choices are strings, the field should store strings. So perhaps the issue is that the model's field is not correctly using the choices parameter.\n\nWait, maybe the model's field is using the wrong choices. For example, if the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, but MyChoice is a TextChoices, then the field should store strings.

But in the user's case, the field is returning the enum instance, which suggests that the choices are using the enum instances as the second element in the tuples.\n\nWait, perhaps the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.values()`, which would return the string values, but that's not correct because choices should be tuples of (display_value, enum_instance).\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe user's issue is that when they create an instance of the model, the field's value is the enum instance, not the string. But the test expects it to be a string. So perhaps the model's field is not correctly configured to store the string.\n\nOne possible solution is to modify the model's field to use the string representation of the enum.

Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nFrom the issue description, when a model uses choices like MyChoice, the field's value is returning the enum instance instead of just the string. For example, MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE is an enum, and when accessed, it's still an enum, not a string. This causes test failures because the test expects a string.\n\nThe user mentioned they've already handled the test files, so I don't need to touch those. My focus is on the non-test files in the /workspace directory.\n\nI remember that in Django, when you use choices with enums, the field defaults to storing the enum instance. To make it store the string instead, we need to set the `choices` parameter correctly. But wait, the user's problem is that the value is the enum instance, not the string. So perhaps the model is using the wrong choices.\n\nLooking at the example, the model uses MyChoice.choices, which is a tuple of tuples. The second element is the string. But maybe the model should be using the enum instances as the choices. Alternatively, perhaps the model should be using the `choices` parameter with the enum instances, and then the field will store the string.\n\nWait, no. The `choices` parameter in Django's models should be a list of tuples where the first element is the displayed value, and the second is the enum instance. So when the model is created, it should store the enum instance, but when retrieved, it's converted to the string.\n\nBut the user's test expects the value to be a string. So perhaps the model is not correctly converting the enum to a string when saving, or the field is not being set to store strings.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the model is using the wrong choices. Let me think: if the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, and MyChoice is a TextChoices, then the field will store the string value. But in the user's case, it's storing the enum instance. So perhaps the model is using the wrong choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the model is using a different type of choices, like IntegerChoices, which are backed by integers. So when the enum is used, it's not correctly converting to the string.\n\nWait, the issue description says that the value is of the same type as the enum value. So when the user creates an instance, my_object.my_str_value is an enum, not a string. But the test expects it to be a string.\n\nSo to fix this, the model should store the string representation of the enum. One way to do this is to use the `formfield` parameter with `empty_values` to ensure that the value is stored as a string. Alternatively, perhaps the model's field should be defined with `choices` as the string values, not the enum instances.\n\nWait, no. The `choices` parameter in Django's models should be a list of tuples where the first element is the string representation, and the second is the enum instance. So when the model is saved, it stores the enum instance, but when retrieved, it's converted to the string.\n\nBut in the user's case, the field is returning the enum instance, not the string. So perhaps the model is not correctly configured to store the string. Maybe the field is defined without specifying that it should store strings.\n\nWait, perhaps the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, but MyChoice is a TextChoices, so the field should store strings. But in the user's case, it's storing the enum. So maybe the model is using a different type of choices, like IntegerChoices, which are integers, and thus the field is storing integers instead of strings.\n\nWait, the issue says that the value is of the same type as the enum value. So if the enum is an IntegerChoices, the field would store integers. But in the user's case, the field is returning the enum instance, which suggests that the choices are using the enum instances as the second element in the tuples.\n\nSo perhaps the model's field is defined as `choices=MyChoice.choices`, where MyChoice is a TextChoices, so the field should store strings.

Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe user's issue is that when they create an instance of the model, the field's value is the enum instance, not the string. But the test expects it to be a string.
