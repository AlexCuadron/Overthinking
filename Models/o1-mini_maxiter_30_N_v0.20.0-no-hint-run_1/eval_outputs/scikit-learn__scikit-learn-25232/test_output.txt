-
     Notes
     -----
     To support imputation in inductive mode we store each feature's estimator
     during the :meth:`fit` phase, and predict without refitting (in order)
     during the :meth:`transform` phase.
-
     Features which contain all missing values at :meth:`fit` are discarded upon
     :meth:`transform`.
-
     Using defaults, the imputer scales in :math:`\\mathcal{O}(knp^3\\min(n,p))`
     where :math:`k` = `max_iter`, :math:`n` the number of samples and
     :math:`p` the number of features. It thus becomes prohibitively costly when
     the number of features increases. Setting
     `n_nearest_features << n_features`, `skip_complete=True` or increasing `tol`
     can help to reduce its computational cost.
-
     Depending on the nature of missing values, simple imputers can be
     preferable in a prediction context.

      Successfully uninstalled scikit-learn-1.3.dev0
  DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of scikit-learn==1.3.dev0 from file:///testbed (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.0 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.
