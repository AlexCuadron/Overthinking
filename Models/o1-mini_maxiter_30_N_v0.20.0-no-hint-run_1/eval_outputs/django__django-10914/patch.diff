     untrusted users! See the security guide's topic on
     :ref:`user-uploaded-content-security` for mitigation details.
+.. warning::
+
+    Without explicitly configuring `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, the permissions for a file uploaded to `FileSystemStorage` might not be consistent depending on whether a `MemoryUploadedFile` or a `TemporaryUploadedFile` was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data. It's recommended to set `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to ensure consistent file permissions for uploaded files.
