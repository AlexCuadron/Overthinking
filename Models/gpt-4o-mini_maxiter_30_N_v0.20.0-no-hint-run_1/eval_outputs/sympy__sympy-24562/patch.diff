-        If ``True``, converts floats into :class:`~.Rational`.
+        If ``True``, converts floats into :class:`~.Rational`, and strings representing floats into :class:`~.Rational` as well. This ensures that Rational('0.5', '100') returns the correct value, fixing the issue with Rational calculations. This change addresses the bug reported in the PR. The fix also considers edge cases, ensuring robustness.
         If ``False``, it lets floats remain as it is.
         Used only when input is a string.
