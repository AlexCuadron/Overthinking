Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.
