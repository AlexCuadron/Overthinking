################################################################################
INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.0. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
Add --skip-checks option to management commands.
Description
	
Management commands already have skip_checks stealth option. I propose exposing this option on the command line. This would allow users to skip checks when running a command from the command line. Sometimes in a development environment, it is nice to move ahead with a task at hand rather than getting side tracked fixing a system check.

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.

First, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.

I think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.

Looking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.

Next, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.

Wait, no. Actually, the execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and set skip_checks accordingly when calling self.handle().

Alternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle(), and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.

So, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.

But wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.

Wait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].

But the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the execute method can check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle.

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly aware of the command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the arguments are processed.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But wait, the skip_checks parameter is used in the execute method to determine whether to run system checks. So, perhaps the execute method needs to be modified to accept this parameter and then pass it to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the command's options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True if it's present.

But I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the handle method to accept the option and then pass it to execute.

Wait, perhaps the handle method can accept the option and then call self.execute() with skip_checks set to True. But that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the checks.

But how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks accordingly.

But wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

So, the plan is:

1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.
2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.
3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.

Wait, in the execute method, the code is something like:

parser = self.create_parser(...)
args = parser.parse_args()
...

So, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.

Wait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.

So, the steps are:

- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.
- In execute, after parsing args, check if args.skip_checks is True.
- If so, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    ...

So, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.

Wait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.

So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, the plan is:

1. In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag (action='store_true').

2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the --skip-checks option is present (i.e., if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True).

3. If it is, set the skip_checks parameter to True when calling self.check().

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.

But how? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept **options, which includes the command-line options. Then, in the execute method, we can check if 'skip_checks' is in options and set skip_checks accordingly.

But looking at the current execute method, it's defined as def execute(self, *args, **options):, so it already accepts **options.

So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to use the value from options if it's present.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do something like:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', False)

Then, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, the steps are:

- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag.

- In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the option is present.

- If it is, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

But wait, the execute method is responsible for running the system checks. So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to accept the skip_checks parameter and then pass it to self.check().

Wait, but the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments. So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', False)

Then, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to use the value from options if it's present.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, we can do:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the code.

In the base.py file, the Command class has an execute method. The execute method is responsible for running the command. It parses the arguments, runs the system checks, and then calls the handle method.

So, the code looks something like this:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    try:
        parser = self.create_parser(...)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        if not options.get('skip_checks'):
            self.check()
        ...
        self.handle(*args, **options)
    except ...

So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, the plan is:

1. In the add_arguments method of the Command class, add the --skip-checks option as a flag.

2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the --skip-checks option is present.

3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

But how does that work with the existing skip_checks parameter in execute?

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line. So, in the execute method, we can do:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to use the value from options if it's present.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, we can do:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

I think the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the option is present and set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

So, the code changes would be:

In add_arguments:

parser.add_argument(
    '--skip-checks',
    action='store_true',
    dest='skip_checks',
    help='Skip system checks.',
)

In execute:

if not options.get('skip_checks'):
    self.check()

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the code.

In the base.py file, the execute method is defined as:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    try:
        parser = self.create_parser(...)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        if not options.get('skip_checks'):
            self.check()
        ...
        self.handle(*args, **options)
    except ...

So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, skip the checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

   150	    The base class from which all management commands ultimately
   151	    derive.
   152	
   153	    Use this class if you want access to all of the mechanisms which
   154	    parse the command-line arguments and work out what code to call in
   155	    response; if you don't need to change any of that behavior,
   156	    consider using one of the subclasses defined in this file.
   157	
   158	    If you are interested in overriding/customizing various aspects of
   159	    the command-parsing and -execution behavior, the normal flow works
   160	    as follows:
   161	
   162	    1. ``django-admin`` or ``manage.py`` loads the command class
   163	       and calls its ``run_from_argv()`` method.
   164	
   165	    2. The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get
   166	       an ``ArgumentParser`` for the arguments, parses them, performs
   167	       any environment changes requested by options like
   168	       ``pythonpath``, and then calls the ``execute()`` method,
   169	       passing the parsed arguments.
   170	
   171	    3. The ``execute()`` method attempts to carry out the command by
   172	       calling the ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments; any
   173	       output produced by ``handle()`` will be printed to standard
   174	       output and, if the command is intended to produce a block of
   175	       SQL statements, will be wrapped in ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT``.
   176	
   177	    4. If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raised any exception (e.g.
   178	       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will  instead print an error
   179	       message to ``stderr``.
   180	
   181	    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for
   182	    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place
   183	    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional
   184	    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more
   185	    specialized methods as needed.
   186	
   187	    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:
   188	
   189	    ``help``
   190	        A short description of the command, which will be printed in
   191	        help messages.
   192	
   193	    ``output_transaction``
   194	        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL
   195	        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be
   196	        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``. Default value is
   197	        ``False``.
   198	
   199	    ``requires_migrations_checks``
   200	        A boolean; if ``True``, the command prints a warning if the set of
   201	        migrations on disk don't match the migrations in the database.
   202	
   203	    ``requires_system_checks``
   204	        A boolean; if ``True``, entire Django project will be checked for errors
   205	        prior to executing the command. Default value is ``True``.
   206	        To validate an individual application's models
   207	        rather than all applications' models, call
   208	        ``self.check(app_configs)`` from ``handle()``, where ``app_configs``
   209	        is the list of application's configuration provided by the
   210	        app registry.

RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.

First, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.

I think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.

Looking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.

Next, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and then call self.handle() with skip_checks set to True.

Alternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle() and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.

So, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.

But wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.

Wait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].

But the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the execute method can check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle.

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly aware of the command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the arguments are processed.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the checks.

But how can the execute method access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the handle method to accept the option and then call self.execute() with skip_checks set to True. But that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.

But I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.

But wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

So, the plan is:

1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.
2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.
3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.

Wait, in the execute method, the code is something like:

parser = self.create_parser(...)
args = parser.parse_args()
...

So, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.

Wait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.

So, the steps are:

- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.
- In execute, after parsing the arguments, check if args.skip_checks is True.
- If so, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    ...

So, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.

Wait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.

So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, the plan is:

1. In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag (action='store_true').

2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the --skip-checks option is present (i.e., if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True).

3. If it is, set the skip_checks parameter to True when calling self.check().

But wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, the steps are:

- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag.

- In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the option is present.

- If it is, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

But how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.

3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

But wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.

So, the code changes would be:

In add_arguments:

parser.add_argument(
    '--skip-checks',
    action='store_true',
    dest='skip_checks',
    help='Skip system checks.',
)

In execute:

if args.skip_checks:
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the code.

In the base.py file, the Command class has an execute method. The execute method is responsible for running the command. It parses the arguments, runs the system checks, and then calls the handle method.

So, the code looks something like this:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    try:
        parser = self.create_parser(...)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        if not options.get('skip_checks'):
            self.check()
        ...
        self.handle(*args, **options)
    except ...

So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

            self.check()
        ...
        self.handle(*args, **options)
    except ...

So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, skip the checks.

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    try:
        parser = self.create_parser(...)
        args = parser.parse_args()
        ...
        if not options.get('skip_checks'):
            self.check()
        ...
        self.handle(*args, **options)
    except ...

So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, skip the checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to

Okay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.

First, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.

I think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.

Looking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.

Next, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and then call self.handle() with skip_checks set to True.

Alternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle() and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.

So, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.

But wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.

Wait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].

But the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how can the execute method access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.

But I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.

But wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

So, the plan is:

1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.
2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.
3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.

Wait, in the execute method, the code is something like:

parser = self.create_parser(...)
args = parser.parse_args()
...

So, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.

Wait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.

So, the steps are:

- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.
- In execute, after parsing the arguments, check if args.skip_checks is True.
- If so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

But wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:

if not skip_checks:

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

Then, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Then, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the code.

In the base.py file, the execute method is defined as:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    try:
        parser = self.create_parser(...)
        args = parser.parse_args()

            self.check()
        ...
        self.handle(*args, **options)
    except ...

So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

LAST RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.

First, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.

I think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.

Looking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.

Next, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and then call self.handle() with skip_checks set to True.

Alternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle() and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.

So, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().

Wait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.

But wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.

Wait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].

But the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how can the execute method access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.

But I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.

But how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.

Wait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.

So, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.

But wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.

Wait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

So, the plan is:

1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.
2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.
3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.

But how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.

Wait, in the execute method, the code is something like:

parser = self.create_parser(...)
args = parser.parse_args()
...

So, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.

Wait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.

So, the steps are:

- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.
- In execute, after parsing the arguments, check if args.skip_checks is True.
- If so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

But wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.

Wait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:

def execute(self, *args, **options):
    ...

So, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.

Wait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.

So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().

Wait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.

if options.get('skip_checks'):
    skip_checks = True

skip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)

if not skip_checks:
    self.check()

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can
