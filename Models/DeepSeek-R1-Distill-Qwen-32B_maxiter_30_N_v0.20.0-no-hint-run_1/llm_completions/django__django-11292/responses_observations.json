      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.\n\nI think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and set skip_checks accordingly when calling self.handle().\n\nAlternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle(), and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.\n\nSo, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].\n\nBut the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the execute method can check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle.\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly aware of the command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the arguments are processed.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut wait, the skip_checks parameter is used in the execute method to determine whether to run system checks. So, perhaps the execute method needs to be modified to accept this parameter and then pass it to handle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the command's options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True if it's present.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the handle method to accept the option and then pass it to execute.\n\nWait, perhaps the handle method can accept the option and then call self.execute() with skip_checks set to True. But that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.\n3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.\n\nWait, in the execute method, the code is something like:\n\nparser = self.create_parser(...)\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n...\n\nSo, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.\n\nWait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.\n- In execute, after parsing args, check if args.skip_checks is True.\n- If so, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    ...\n\nSo, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.\n\nWait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.\n\nSo, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag (action='store_true').\n\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the --skip-checks option is present (i.e., if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True).\n\n3. If it is, set the skip_checks parameter to True when calling self.check().\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.\n\nBut how? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept **options, which includes the command-line options. Then, in the execute method, we can check if 'skip_checks' is in options and set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nBut looking at the current execute method, it's defined as def execute(self, *args, **options):, so it already accepts **options.\n\nSo, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to use the value from options if it's present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do something like:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', False)\n\nThen, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag.\n\n- In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the option is present.\n\n- If it is, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nBut wait, the execute method is responsible for running the system checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the code.\n\nIn the base.py file, the Command class has an execute method. The execute method is responsible for running the command. It parses the arguments, runs the system checks, and then calls the handle method.\n\nSo, the code looks something like this:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    try:\n        parser = self.create_parser(...)\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n        ...\n        if not options.get('skip_checks'):\n            self.check()\n        ...\n        self.handle(*args, **options)\n    except ...\n\nSo, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. In the add_arguments method of the Command class, add the --skip-checks option as a flag.\n\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the --skip-checks option is present.\n\n3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nBut how does that work with the existing skip_checks parameter in execute?\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line. So, in the execute method, we can do:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nWait, but that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nI think the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the option is present and set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nSo, the code changes would be:\n\nIn add_arguments:\n\nparser.add_argument(\n    '--skip-checks',\n    action='store_true',\n    dest='skip_checks',\n    help='Skip system checks.',\n)\n\nIn execute:\n\nif not options.get('skip_checks'):\n    self.check()\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nif not skip_checks:\n    self.check()\n\nWait, but that might not be the right approach.

So, perhaps the code should be:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nif not skip_checks:\n    self.check()\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the code.\n\nIn the base.py file, the execute method is defined as:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    try:\n        parser = self.create_parser(...)\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n        ...\n        if not options.get('skip_checks'):\n            self.check()\n        ...\n        self.handle(*args, **options)\n    except ...\n\nSo, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, skip the checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nif not skip_checks:\n    self.check()\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:\n\nif options.get('skip_checks'):\n    skip_checks = True\n\nThen, when calling self.check(), we pass skip_checks=skip_checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter.

    {
      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.\n\nI think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and then call self.handle() with skip_checks set to True.\n\nAlternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle() and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.\n\nSo, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].\n\nBut the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the execute method can check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle.\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly aware of the command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the arguments are processed.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the handle method to accept the option and then call self.execute() with skip_checks set to True. But that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.\n\nBut wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.\n3.

Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.\n\nWait, in the execute method, the code is something like:\n\nparser = self.create_parser(...)\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n...\n\nSo, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.\n\nWait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.\n- In execute, after parsing the arguments, check if args.skip_checks is True.\n- If so, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    ...\n\nSo, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.\n\nWait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.\n\nSo, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option as a flag (action='store_true').\n\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if the --skip-checks option is present (i.e., if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True).\n\n3. If it is, set the skip_checks parameter to True when calling self.check().\n\nBut wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter.

So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to self.check().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check the options and then set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nSo, the code changes would be:\n\nIn add_arguments:\n\nparser.add_argument(\n    '--skip-checks',\n    action='store_true',\n    dest='skip_checks',\n    help='Skip system checks.',\n)\n\nIn execute:\n\nif args.skip_checks:\n    skip_checks = True\n\nThen, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nif not skip_checks:\n    self.check()\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:\n\nif options.get('skip_checks'):\n    skip_checks = True\n\nThen, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter.

Let me think about the code.\n\nIn the base.py file, the Command class has an execute method. The execute method is responsible for running the command. It parses the arguments, runs the system checks, and then calls the handle method.\n\nSo, the code looks something like this:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    try:\n        parser = self.create_parser(...)\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n        ...\n        if not options.get('skip_checks'):\n            self.check()\n        ...\n        self.handle(*args, **options)\n    except ...\n\nSo, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter.

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.\n\nI think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and then call self.handle() with skip_checks set to True.\n\nAlternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle() and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.\n\nSo, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].\n\nBut the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.\n\nBut wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.\n3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how does the execute method access the parsed arguments?

      "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user implement the --skip-checks option for Django management commands. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue description says that management commands already have a skip_checks stealth option, but it's not exposed on the command line. The user wants to add this option so that users can skip system checks when running commands from the CLI. This is useful in development environments where you might want to proceed without fixing checks immediately.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded files are in /workspace/django__django__3.0. I remember that Django's management commands are located in the django/core/management directory. The base Command class is in base.py, and individual commands are in subdirectories like commands/.\n\nI think the first step is to modify the base Command class to accept the --skip-checks option. This way, all management commands will inherit this option. Alternatively, I can create a mixin that adds this option to commands, but modifying the base class might be more straightforward.\n\nLooking at the base.py file, the Command class has an add_arguments method where command-line options are defined. I'll need to add a new argument here. The option should be --skip-checks, and it should be a flag (action='store_true') so that when it's present, skip_checks is set to True.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that when this option is used, the skip_checks parameter is passed to the execute method. The Command class has an execute method that takes skip_checks as an argument. So, in the handle method, I should check if the --skip-checks option was provided and then call execute accordingly.\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and the handle method is where the command's logic is implemented. So, perhaps I need to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the handle method. Or maybe the handle method should accept skip_checks as a parameter.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to modify the Command class to include the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the execute method, check if the option was provided and then call self.handle() with skip_checks set to True.\n\nAlternatively, since the skip_checks is already a parameter in the execute method, maybe I can modify the execute method to accept it and then pass it to handle. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, looking at Django's source code, the Command class's execute method is responsible for running the command. It calls self.handle() and any exceptions are caught and handled. The skip_checks parameter is already part of the execute method's signature, but it's not exposed to the command line.\n\nSo, to expose it, I need to add an argument in add_arguments, and then in execute, if the argument is present, set skip_checks to True when calling self.handle().\n\nWait, no. The execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly taking command-line arguments. Instead, the handle method is where the command logic is, and it's called by execute. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the handle method doesn't take skip_checks as a parameter. So, perhaps I need to modify the handle method to accept it, but that would require changes in all commands, which isn't feasible. Alternatively, I can modify the execute method to pass the option to handle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the option is present and then set skip_checks when calling handle. But how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to create a new base class that includes this option, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can modify the existing Command class to include the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to handle. But since execute is called by the management system, I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the handle method can be modified to accept **options, which would include the --skip-checks flag. Then, in the handle method, we can check if skip_checks is True and proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, but the handle method's signature is def handle(self, *args, **options). So, any command-line options added via add_arguments will be passed as keyword arguments to handle. So, if I add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in handle as options['skip_checks'].\n\nBut the execute method is responsible for running the command, and it's the one that calls handle. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set skip_checks to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem.

Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.\n\nBut wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.\n3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.\n\nWait, in the execute method, the code is something like:\n\nparser = self.create_parser(...)\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n...\n\nSo, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.\n\nWait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.\n- In execute, after parsing the arguments, check if args.skip_checks is True.\n- If so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nBut wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    ...\n\nSo, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.\n\nWait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.\n\nSo, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter.

Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to look for the --skip-checks option in the command's options and then set skip_checks to True when calling handle.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to access the command's options from execute. Maybe it's better to modify the execute method to accept the option and then pass it to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the --skip-checks option in add_arguments, and then in the handle method, check if it's present and set a variable, say, skip_checks, to True. Then, when the command runs, it can skip the checks.\n\nBut how does that affect the system checks? Because the system checks are run before the handle method is called. So, if the handle method is where the option is processed, it might be too late to skip the checks.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the system checks are run in the execute method before handle is called. So, if the option is processed in handle, the checks would have already been run.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the execute method to check for the --skip-checks option and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how can the execute method access the command-line arguments? Because the execute method is called by the management system, and it's not directly passed the command-line arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can access the command's options via self.options, which is a dictionary of the parsed command-line arguments.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can check if '--skip-checks' is in self.options and set skip_checks to True if it's present.\n\nBut wait, the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments. So, perhaps in the execute method, after calling self.add_arguments(parser), we can parse the arguments and then check if '--skip-checks' is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the option and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to check if the --skip-checks option is present and then set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Modify the base Command class's add_arguments method to add the --skip-checks option.\n2. In the execute method, after parsing the arguments, check if --skip-checks is present.\n3. If it is, set skip_checks to True when running the system checks.\n\nBut how does the execute method access the parsed arguments? Because the execute method is responsible for parsing the arguments.\n\nWait, in the execute method, the code is something like:\n\nparser = self.create_parser(...)\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n...\n\nSo, after parsing, args will have the options. So, in the execute method, after parsing, we can check if args.skip_checks is True.\n\nWait, but the option is added in add_arguments, so the parsed args will have the attribute.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- In add_arguments, add the --skip-checks option.\n- In execute, after parsing the arguments, check if args.skip_checks is True.\n- If so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nBut wait, the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps we can modify the execute method to accept this parameter and then pass it to the system check method.\n\nWait, looking at the current execute method in Django's base.py, it's defined as:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    ...\n\nSo, the options parameter includes any command-line options passed. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in options.\n\nWait, no. Because the execute method is called by the management system, and the options are passed as keyword arguments. So, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be available in options.\n\nSo, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and then set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nif not skip_checks:\n    self.check()\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to set skip_checks to the value from options, overriding the default.\n\nSo, in the execute method, after parsing the arguments, we can do:\n\nif options.get('skip_checks'):\n    skip_checks = True\n\nThen, when calling self.check(), pass skip_checks=skip_checks.\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter. So, perhaps the code should be:\n\nskip_checks = options.get('skip_checks', skip_checks)\n\nif not skip_checks:\n    self.check()\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the execute method can be modified to accept the skip_checks parameter, which is passed via the command line.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the code.\n\nIn the base.py file, the execute method is defined as:\n\ndef execute(self, *args, **options):\n    try:\n        parser = self.create_parser(...)\n        args = parser.parse_args()\n        ...\n        if not options.get('skip_checks'):\n            self.check()\n        ...\n        self.handle(*args, **options)\n    except ...\n\nSo, if we add the --skip-checks option, it will be in the options dictionary. So, in the execute method, we can check if options.get('skip_checks', False) is True, and if so, set skip_checks to True when calling self.check().\n\nWait, but the execute method already has a skip_checks parameter.
