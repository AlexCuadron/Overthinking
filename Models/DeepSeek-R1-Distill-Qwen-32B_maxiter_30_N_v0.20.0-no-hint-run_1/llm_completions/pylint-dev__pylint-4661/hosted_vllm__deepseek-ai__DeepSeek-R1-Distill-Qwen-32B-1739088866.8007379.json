By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

From the issue description, the problem is that pylint is creating a `.pylint.d` directory in the user's home folder, which isn't ideal. The user wants this data to be stored in the appropriate XDG directory, specifically `$HOME/.local/share/pylint`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where pylint is currently storing its data. The user mentioned that it's using `.pylint.d`, so I should look into the pylint codebase to find where this directory is defined. The user provided the repository path as `/workspace/pylint-dev__pylint__2.10`, so I'll start by exploring this directory.\n\nI used the `execute_bash` function to list the contents of the repository, focusing on files that might handle configuration or utilities. The result showed several `utils.py` files in different directories, which is a good starting point. These files are likely where the data storage paths are defined.\n\nNext, I need to identify exactly where the `.pylint.d` path is set. I'll look through the `utils.py` files in the `pylint/utils` and `pylint/config` directories. In `pylint/utils/utils.py`, I found a function `get_home_dir()` that returns the home directory. This is where the `.pylint.d` directory is probably being appended.\n\nTo make pylint XDG-compliant, I need to modify this function to return the XDG data directory instead. The XDG specification suggests using `$HOME/.local/share/<PROGRAM_NAME>`, so in this case, it should be `$HOME/.local/share/pylint`.\n\nI'll create a new function `get_xdg_data_dir()` that constructs this path. This function will check if the directory exists and create it if necessary. Then, I'll replace all instances where `get_home_dir()` is used to form the `.pylint.d` path with the new function.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the solution. I'll run pylint and check if the new directory is created in the correct location. Additionally, I'll ensure that any existing data in `.pylint.d` is migrated to the new directory to avoid data loss.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases, such as when the user doesn't have write permissions to the new directory or if the directory structure is nested in a way that could cause issues. Handling these cases will make the solution more robust.\n\nOverall, the key steps are:\n1. Locate where the `.pylint.d` path is defined in the codebase.\n2. Modify the code to use the XDG-compliant path.\n3. Ensure the new directory is created and accessible.\n4. Test the changes thoroughly to confirm the issue is resolved.\n\nBy following these steps, I can help the user achieve their goal of making pylint compliant with the XDG Base Directory Specification.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 729, "prompt_tokens": 4025, "total_tokens": 4754, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739088866.800747, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
