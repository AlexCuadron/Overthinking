The problem occurs when trying to add a zero vector to another vector using Python's built-in `sum()` function. The error suggests that the addition operation is receiving a non-Vector type, which shouldn't happen if the multiplication by zero is handled correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the repository structure. The uploaded files are in `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1`, which appears to be a version of the SymPy library. The specific error occurs in the `physics/vector` module.\n\nLet me start by creating a script to reproduce the error:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame, Vector\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\nN = ReferenceFrame('N')\nvectors = [N.x, (0 * N.x)]\nresult = sum(vectors)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nI'll execute this script using the BashTool to confirm the error.\n\nNext, I'll explore the Vector class implementation in `sympy.physics.vector.vector` to understand how scalar multiplication and addition are handled. The error occurs in the `__add__` method when trying to add a non-Vector type. This suggests that `0 * N.x` is not returning a Vector instance as expected.\n\nLooking at the Vector class:\n- The `__mul__` method handles multiplication by scalars and other vectors.\n- However, there's no `__rmul__` method, which is called when the left operand doesn't implement `__mul__`. This means that when we do `0 * N.x`, Python is using the scalar's `__mul__` method, which doesn't know how to handle Vector instances, resulting in a scalar zero instead of a Vector.\n\nTo fix this, I need to implement the `__rmul__` method in the Vector class to handle cases where a scalar is multiplied by a Vector. This method should ensure that the result is always a Vector, even when multiplied by zero.\n\nI'll modify the Vector class by adding an `__rmul__` method that checks if the other operand is a scalar and returns a new Vector with components scaled by that scalar.\n\nAfter making this change, I'll rerun the test script to ensure the error is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases such as:\n- Multiplying by different scalar types (int, float, Symbol)\n- Using negative scalars\n- Chaining multiple operations involving zero vectors\n\nThis fix should ensure that scalar multiplication always returns a Vector instance, preventing the TypeError when using functions like `sum()` on lists of vectors.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by creating a script to reproduce the error:\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/test_vector.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nfrom sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame, Vector\nfrom sympy import symbols\n\nN = ReferenceFrame('N')\nvectors = [N.x, (0 * N.x)]\nresult = sum(vectors)\nprint(result)\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nFile created successfully at: /workspace/test_vector.py"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8aadcbb3dae842ac8e8b86c5f4f5f07b", "created": 1739094133, "model": "hosted_vllm/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\nLet me execute the test script to confirm the error:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\npython3 /workspace/test_vector.py\n</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so the user has an issue with SymPy where adding a zero vector using the sum function throws a TypeError. The error message says that a Vector must be supplied, which implies that the zero vector isn't being recognized as a Vector instance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why this is happening. The user provided a code snippet where they're summing a list containing N.x and 0 * N.x. The problem arises when 0 * N.x doesn't return a Vector, causing the sum to fail.\n\nI remember that in Python, when you multiply a scalar by an object, if the object doesn't handle it, Python tries the scalar's __mul__ method. If the scalar's method doesn't know how to handle the object, it returns NotImplemented, and then Python checks the object's __rmul__ method. So, if the Vector class doesn't have an __rmul__ method, multiplying a scalar by a Vector might not work as expected.\n\nLooking at the Vector class in SymPy, I check if there's an __rmul__ method. If it's missing, that's likely the issue. Without __rmul__, 0 * N.x might return 0 instead of a zero Vector, which would cause the sum to fail because it's trying to add a scalar to a Vector.\n\nSo, the solution is to add an __rmul__ method to the Vector class. This method should handle cases where a scalar is multiplied by a Vector. It should return a new Vector where each component is multiplied by the scalar. This way, 0 * N.x would return a zero Vector, allowing the sum function to work correctly.\n\nI'll modify the Vector class by adding the __rmul__ method. This method will check if the other operand is a scalar and then return a new Vector with components scaled by that scalar. This should fix the issue and handle edge cases like different scalar types and negative values.\n\nAfter making this change, I'll rerun the test script to ensure the error is resolved. This should confirm that the fix works as intended.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 462, "prompt_tokens": 4178, "total_tokens": 4640, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739094284.7242858, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
