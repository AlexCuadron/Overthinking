Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nAllow ModelForm meta to specify formfield_callback.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Klaas-Jan Gorter)\n\t \nThe function django.forms.modelform_factory returns a form class based on the class it recieves as form argument. As an additional argument it accepts a formfield_callback function. When no callback is provided the class uses no callback instead of the formfield_callback of the base form provided.\nExample:\nfrom django import forms\nform django.db import models\nclass MyModel(forms.Model):\n\tactive = models.BooleanField()\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=64, blank=True, null=True)\n\t\ndef all_required(field, **kwargs):\n\tformfield = field.formfield(**kwargs)\n\tformfield.required = True\n\treturn formfield\nclass MyForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tformfield_callback = all_required\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = MyModel\n\t\tformfield_callback = all_required\n\t\tfields = ['active', 'name']\nFactoryForm = forms.modelform_factory(MyModel, form=MyForm)\nThe expected behavior would be that the FactoryForm uses the formfield_callback specified in the Meta attribute of MyForm and that therefore the fields would be required in both the FactoryForm and MyForm. However, under the current behavior of modelform_factory the formfield_callback is overwritten (with the default argument None) before the new class is constructed and in FactoryForm the fields are not required.\nI believe this is a bug, because this behavior has been observed before in Ticket #18573 in Django 1.3. The test that was proposed there was incorrect, because under the expected behavior the callback should have been called four times not two times as was asserted. (I believe this test has been removed from version 2, because I find no equivalent test in tests/model_formsets_regress.)\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem is that when using `modelform_factory` with a custom `formfield_callback` defined in the `Meta` class of a `ModelForm`, the callback isn't being respected. This means that any custom validation or field modifications defined in the callback aren't being applied when the form is generated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how `modelform_factory` works. From the code, I know that `modelform_factory` is responsible for creating a `ModelForm` class based on a model and additional parameters. One of these parameters is `formfield_callback`, which allows developers to customize how model fields are converted into form fields.\n\nLooking at the current implementation in `django/forms/models.py`, the `modelform_factory` function accepts a `formfield_callback` parameter. However, when a custom form is provided (using the `form` parameter), the function doesn't properly inherit the `formfield_callback` from the provided form's `Meta` class. This is the root cause of the issue.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the `modelform_factory` function to check if the provided form has a `formfield_callback` defined in its `Meta` class. If it does, this callback should be used instead of the default one.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Check if the provided `form` parameter has a `Meta` class.\n2. If it does, check if `Meta` has a `formfield_callback` attribute.\n3. If `formfield_callback` is found in `Meta`, use it as the default callback.\n4. Update the function to use this callback when generating the form fields.\n\nI'll also need to ensure that this change doesn't break any existing functionality. For example, if a user provides both a `form` with a `formfield_callback` and a `formfield_callback` parameter, the parameter should take precedence.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in code. I'll need to modify the `modelform_factory` function in `django/forms/models.py`. Specifically, I'll add logic to check for the presence of `formfield_callback` in the provided form's `Meta` class before using the default callback.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the fix by running the provided script. This will help confirm that the `formfield_callback` is now being respected when using `modelform_factory`.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as when the `formfield_callback` is `None` or when multiple forms are involved. However, the main fix should handle the general case where the `formfield_callback` is correctly inherited from the provided form's `Meta` class.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's implement the necessary changes:\n\n1.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user provided an issue where the ModelForm's Meta class isn't respecting the formfield_callback. They have a custom callback that's supposed to make all fields required, but when using modelform_factory, it's not working as expected.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the code example they provided. They have a MyForm that sets formfield_callback in Meta. Then, they create FactoryForm using modelform_factory with form=MyForm. The problem is that FactoryForm doesn't use the callback, so fields aren't required.\n\nI remember that modelform_factory is supposed to use the form's formfield_callback if provided. But in the current code, it's not happening. So, I need to find where the formfield_callback is being set in the factory function.\n\nLooking at the Django source, modelform_factory is in django/forms/models.py. The function takes formfield_callback as an argument. If form is provided, it should use the form's formfield_callback. But perhaps it's not correctly inheriting it.\n\nIn the current code, modelform_factory might be ignoring the form's callback. So, I need to modify it to check if the form has a formfield_callback and use that if provided.\n\nI'll plan to edit the modelform_factory function. I'll add a condition: if form is not None and form has a formfield_callback, then use that. Otherwise, use the provided formfield_callback or default to None.\n\nAfter making this change, I should test it. The user provided a script to reproduce the error, so I'll run that to confirm the fix.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases, like if the form's callback is None or if multiple forms are involved. But the main fix should handle the general case where the form's callback is correctly used.\n\nSo, the steps are: edit the modelform_factory to check for form's callback, then test with the provided script to ensure it works.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1268, "prompt_tokens": 3590, "total_tokens": 4858, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739084190.212457, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

This will help confirm that the `formfield_callback` is now being respected when using `modelform_factory`.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as when the `formfield_callback` is `None` or when multiple forms are involved. However, the main fix should handle the general case where the `formfield_callback` is correctly inherited from the provided form's `Meta` class.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's implement the necessary changes:\n\n1.
