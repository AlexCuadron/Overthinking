By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run.

The problem is that the `Apps.clear_cache()` method isn't clearing the cache for `get_swappable_settings_name`. Let me break down what I need to do step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the repository. The user mentioned that the code is in `/workspace/django__django__5.0`. I'll start by exploring this directory to find where the `Apps` class is defined. Typically, in Django, this would be in the `django/apps` module, so I'll look for a file like `apps.py` there.\n\nNext, I need to identify the `clear_cache` method within the `Apps` class. Once I find it, I should check if it's clearing all necessary caches. The issue states that `get_swappable_settings_name` uses an LRU cache, which isn't being cleared by the current method. So, I'll need to add a line to clear this specific cache.\n\nI remember that in Python, to clear an LRU cache, you can call `cache_clear()` on the method. So, I'll modify the `clear_cache` method to include `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()`. This should ensure that the cache is properly reset.\n\nBefore making any changes, I should write a script to reproduce the issue. This script will test whether the cache is cleared after calling `clear_cache()`. I'll create a test file, maybe `test_cache.py`, where I set up a Django app, call `clear_cache()`, and then check if the cache for `get_swappable_settings_name` is indeed cleared. If the script fails before the fix and passes after, it confirms that the change works.\n\nAfter making the code change, I'll run the script again to verify that the issue is resolved. It's also important to consider edge cases, such as multiple apps or different settings, but since the user mentioned they've handled tests, I can focus on the core fix.\n\nFinally, I'll document the change and ensure that it's minimal and doesn't affect other parts of the code. This way, the fix is clean and maintainable.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 757, "prompt_tokens": 3485, "total_tokens": 4242, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739086160.2785914, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
