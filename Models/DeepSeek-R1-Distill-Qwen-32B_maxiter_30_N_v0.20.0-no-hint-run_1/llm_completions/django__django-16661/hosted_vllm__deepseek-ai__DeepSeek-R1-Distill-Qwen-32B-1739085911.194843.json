The problem is that Django's ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed() method is incorrectly raising a DisallowedModelAdminLookup error when dealing with foreign keys that are used as primary keys. This is causing valid lookups to be blocked, which shouldn't happen.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository in the provided workspace. From the uploaded files, I can see there's a directory named `django__django__5.0`, which likely contains the Django source code. My goal is to find where the `lookup_allowed` method is defined and modify it to handle foreign keys correctly.\n\nThe `lookup_allowed` method is part of Django's ModelAdmin class, which is located in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. This method is responsible for checking whether a given lookup is allowed in the admin interface. The issue arises because the current implementation incorrectly treats foreign keys as primary keys in certain cases, leading to the DisallowedModelAdminLookup error.\n\nTo reproduce the error, I'll create a test script that sets up the models and admin as described in the issue. This script will attempt to perform the lookup that's failing and should raise the error if the issue isn't fixed.\n\nOnce I've confirmed the error, I'll move on to modifying the source code. The key is to adjust the logic in `lookup_allowed` so that it correctly handles cases where a foreign key is used as a primary key.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue is about ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed() incorrectly raising a DisallowedModelAdminLookup error when a foreign key is used as a primary key. The user provided a test case that fails in Django 5.0 but passes in 1.8. The test involves a model structure with foreign keys and a OneToOneField as the primary key.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the test case to understand what's happening. The models are Country, Place, Restaurant, and Waiter. Restaurant uses a OneToOneField to Place as its primary key. Waiter has a ForeignKey to Restaurant. The admin for Waiter tries to filter by 'restaurant__place__country', but the lookup is disallowed.\n\nI think the problem arises because Django's admin is treating the OneToOneField as a concrete parent model, which it's not in this case. The admin's lookup_allowed method might be incorrectly shortcutting the lookup, thinking that 'place' is a parent of 'restaurant', leading it to check for 'restaurant__country', which doesn't exist.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the lookup_allowed method in ModelAdmin to correctly handle cases where a foreign key is used as a primary key. The method should not treat such fields as part of a concrete inheritance hierarchy.\n\nI'll start by examining the current implementation of lookup_allowed in Django's ModelAdmin. The method checks if the lookup is allowed by ensuring that each part of the lookup is a valid field in the model or its related models. If it encounters a field that's part of a concrete parent, it might shortcut the check, leading to the error.\n\nI need to adjust this logic so that when a field is a foreign key (including OneToOneField), it correctly follows the relationships without assuming a concrete parent. This might involve checking if the field is a relational field and, if so, ensuring that the lookup traverses the relationships properly without shortcutting.\n\nI'll plan to modify the lookup_allowed method to handle foreign keys correctly. Specifically, when a field is a foreign key, the method should continue traversing the relationships rather than treating it as a concrete parent. This way, the lookup 'restaurant__place__country' will correctly resolve through the foreign keys without raising an error.\n\nNext, I'll create a script to reproduce the error. This script will set up the models, create the admin, and attempt the lookup. Running this script should trigger the DisallowedModelAdminLookup error, confirming the issue.\n\nOnce the script reproduces the error, I'll proceed to edit the ModelAdmin's lookup_allowed method. I'll adjust the logic to correctly handle foreign keys as primary keys, ensuring that the lookup traverses the relationships without incorrect assumptions.\n\nAfter making the changes, I'll rerun the script to verify that the error is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases, such as deeper nested lookups or other types of relational fields, to ensure the fix is robust.\n\nFinally, I'll document the changes and ensure that the fix doesn't introduce any new issues. This thorough approach should resolve the problem and allow the test case to pass.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1141, "prompt_tokens": 3510, "total_tokens": 4651, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739085911.194853, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
