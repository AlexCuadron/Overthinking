By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run.

If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

The goal is to modify the `:private-members:` option in Sphinx's autodoc extension to accept specific member names, similar to how `:members:` works.\n\n1. **Understanding the Current Implementation**:\n   - The autodoc extension processes directives like `.. automodule::` and `.. autoclass::`.\n   - The `:private-members:` option is currently a boolean flag that, when set, includes all private members (those starting with double underscores).\n\n2. **Desired Behavior**:\n   - Allow users to specify particular private members to document, e.g., `:private-members: __init__ __repr__`.\n   - Maintain backward compatibility so that using `:private-members:` without arguments continues to include all private members.\n\n3. **Code Structure**:\n   - The relevant code is in `sphinx/ext/autodoc.py`.\n   - The `AutodocDirective` class processes the options for `automodule` and `autoclass`.\n\n4. **Proposed Changes**:\n   - Modify the `private-members` option to accept a list of member names.\n   - Update the member collection logic to respect the specified private members.\n\n5. **Potential Challenges**:\n   - Ensuring backward compatibility.\n   - Handling cases where both `:members:` and `:private-members:` are specified.\n   - Providing clear documentation and error messages.\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - Create test cases to verify that only specified private members are included.\n   - Test with and without arguments for `:private-members:` to ensure compatibility.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Members that don't exist in the class.\n   - Members that are not private but are included in the list.\n   - Interaction with other options like `:exclude-members:`.\n\n8. **Documentation**:\n   - Update the Sphinx documentation to reflect the new functionality.\n   - Provide examples of usage in the docs.\n\n9. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Modify the option definition for `private-members` to accept a value.\n   - Update the member collection logic to filter based on the specified private members.\n   - Add tests to cover the new functionality.\n   - Update the documentation to include the new feature.\n\n10. **Potential Side Effects**:\n    - Ensure that existing users who rely on the old behavior are not affected.\n    - Check for any dependencies or other parts of the code that might be impacted by this change.\n\n11. **User Impact**:\n    - Users will have more control over which private members are documented.\n    - Improved flexibility in documenting specific parts of a class or module.\n\n12. **Final Checks**:\n    - Verify that the changes work as expected.\n    - Ensure that the code remains clean and maintainable.\n    - Check for any performance impacts, especially when dealing with large classes.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure to identify where the autodoc functionality is implemented.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\nls: cannot access '/workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py': No such file or directory\n[The command completed with exit code 2.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 2]"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-9955523cc75e46dd865b8d921dbe9984", "created": 1739091666, "model": "hosted_vllm/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\nLet me help you explore the repository structure properly.

The user tried to list the contents of a specific path but got an error. That means the path they provided doesn't exist. So, I should correct that by exploring the repository properly.\n\nI'll start by listing the contents of the main directory to understand the structure. Once I have that, I can navigate to the correct location of `autodoc.py`. \n\nNext, I'll look into `autodoc.py` to see how the `:private-members:` option is currently handled. I suspect it's a boolean flag, so I'll need to modify it to accept a list of member names. \n\nI should also check how `:members:` is implemented because that's similar to what we want for `:private-members:`. By mirroring that logic, I can ensure consistency and maintain backward compatibility.\n\nAfter identifying the relevant code sections, I'll plan the changes. This includes updating the option definition, modifying the member collection logic, and adding tests to cover the new functionality. \n\nI need to make sure that the changes don't break existing functionality. For example, if someone uses `:private-members:` without arguments, it should still include all private members. Also, if both `:members:` and `:private-members:` are used, they should work together without conflicts.\n\nFinally, I'll update the documentation to reflect the new feature, providing examples and clear usage instructions.
