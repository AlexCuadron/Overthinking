Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided a code example that works for one multiplication but fails on the second. The error is an AttributeError because a 'Zero' object doesn't have 'cols' attribute. Looking at the code, after the first multiplication, the blocks in the resulting matrix are of type Zero instead of ZeroMatrix. That's the root cause.\n\nSo, the problem is that during block multiplication, when a block is zero, it's represented as a scalar Zero instead of a ZeroMatrix. This causes issues when further operations expect matrix attributes like 'cols'.\n\nI need to find where in the code this conversion happens. The BlockMatrix's _blockmul method is likely the place. When blocks are multiplied, if the result is zero, it should return a ZeroMatrix with the appropriate dimensions instead of a scalar Zero.\n\nLooking at the sympy codebase, specifically in blockmatrix.py, the _blockmul method handles the multiplication. I should check how the zero blocks are handled here. If a block multiplication results in zero, it should create a ZeroMatrix with the correct row and column sizes.\n\nAnother place to look is the BlockMatrix constructor. It might be converting ZeroMatrix instances to scalar Zeros, which would cause the issue. Alternatively, during the block multiplication, the code might be returning scalar zeros instead of matrix zeros.\n\nI should also consider the block_collapse function, which might be involved in simplifying the expressions. If it's replacing ZeroMatrix with Zero, that would cause the problem.\n\nTo fix this, I'll need to modify the code so that whenever a zero block is created, it's a ZeroMatrix with the correct dimensions. This means checking in the _blockmul method and ensuring that any zero results are returned as ZeroMatrix instances.\n\nI'll start by examining the _blockmul method. I'll look for where the code handles zero blocks. If a block is zero, it should return a ZeroMatrix with the same rows and columns as the block.\n\nWait, in the current code, when a block is zero, it's represented as a scalar Zero. That's incorrect because in the context of block matrices, zeros should be matrices to maintain the structure.\n\nSo, in the _blockmul method, when a block is determined to be zero, instead of returning a scalar Zero, it should return a ZeroMatrix with the appropriate size. The size can be determined from the block's row and column dimensions.\n\nI'll need to modify the code in blockmatrix.py. Specifically, wherever a zero is created, it should be a ZeroMatrix. For example, in the _blockmul method, when a block is found to be zero, create a ZeroMatrix with the same rows and columns as the block.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. I can check if a block is a ZeroMatrix and then create a new ZeroMatrix with the correct dimensions. Alternatively, I can modify the code to always return ZeroMatrix when the result is zero.\n\nAnother consideration is the block_collapse function. It might be simplifying the expression and replacing ZeroMatrix with Zero, which would cause the issue. I need to ensure that block_collapse doesn't do that and keeps ZeroMatrix as matrices.\n\nWait, looking at the error trace, the exception occurs in the colblocksizes property, which tries to access .cols on a Zero object. This suggests that the block is a scalar Zero instead of a matrix. So, the fix must ensure that all blocks in the BlockMatrix are matrices, even if they are zero.\n\nTherefore, the key is to modify the _blockmul method to return ZeroMatrix instances when the result is zero. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. In blockmatrix.py, locate the _blockmul method.\n2. Identify where zero blocks are created or handled.\n3. Modify the code to return ZeroMatrix instances with the correct dimensions instead of scalar Zeros.\n4. Ensure that the block structure remains consistent after multiplication.\n\nI'll also need to test this change by running the provided example to ensure that multiplying twice doesn't cause an error. Additionally, I should consider other edge cases, such as different block sizes or more complex block structures, to make sure the fix is robust.\n\nAnother possible area to check is the BlockMatrix constructor. It might be converting ZeroMatrix instances to scalar Zeros, which would cause the issue. I should ensure that the constructor accepts and maintains ZeroMatrix blocks correctly.\n\nIn summary, the main fix is to ensure that any zero blocks in the BlockMatrix are represented as ZeroMatrix instances with the correct dimensions, not as scalar Zeros. This will prevent the AttributeError when accessing matrix attributes like 'cols'.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1163, "prompt_tokens": 4317, "total_tokens": 5480, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739094784.9867852, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
