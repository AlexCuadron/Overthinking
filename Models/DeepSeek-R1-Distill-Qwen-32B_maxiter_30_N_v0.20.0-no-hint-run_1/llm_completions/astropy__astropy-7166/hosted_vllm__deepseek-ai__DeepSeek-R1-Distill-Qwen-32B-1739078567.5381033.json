By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

The goal is to modify the InheritDocstrings metaclass so that it properly handles properties, not just functions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the current metaclass works. It likely uses `inspect.isfunction` to check if an attribute is a function before attempting to inherit its docstring.

Modify the metaclass to handle properties similarly to functions\n3.

They've already set up the repository and provided some context about the problem. My task is to help them implement the necessary changes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem deeply. The metaclass uses `inspect.isfunction`, which returns False for properties. That's why properties aren't having their docstrings inherited. So, the main issue is that the metaclass isn't recognizing properties as something it should process.\n\nThe user provided a command that was supposed to find the relevant files, but it didn't work. The exit code was 1, which means there was an error. I need to figure out why that happened and how to adjust the command to get the necessary information.\n\nLooking at the command: `find /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3 -type f -name \"*.py\" | grep -E 'metaclass|inherit_doc'`. This command is trying to find all Python files and then filter them to find those related to metaclass or inherit_doc. But it's possible that the grep part isn't working as intended, or maybe there are no files matching that pattern.\n\nSince the command failed, I should adjust it to ensure it correctly finds the files. Maybe the paths are different, or the filenames don't match the pattern. I'll modify the command to make it more robust. Using `grep -i` for case-insensitive matching and ensuring the paths are correct might help.\n\nSo, I'll change the command to `find /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3 -type f -name \"*.py\" | grep -iE 'metaclass|inherit_doc'`. This should help in finding the correct files by making the search case-insensitive and ensuring the pattern matches any part of the filename.\n\nOnce I have the correct files, I can proceed to analyze the metaclass implementation. I'll look for where `inspect.isfunction` is used and see how to modify it to include properties. Perhaps using `inspect.ismethoddescriptor` or checking if the attribute is a property.\n\nAfter identifying the necessary changes, I'll edit the source code to handle properties. This might involve adding a check for properties and then applying the same docstring inheritance logic as for functions.\n\nFinally, I'll test the changes by running a script that reproduces the error. If the error is fixed, then the changes are successful. I'll also consider edge cases, like properties with their own docstrings or those inherited from multiple levels up.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are: adjust the file search command, analyze the metaclass code, modify it to handle properties, and test the fix.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 628, "prompt_tokens": 3537, "total_tokens": 4165, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739078567.5381167, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
