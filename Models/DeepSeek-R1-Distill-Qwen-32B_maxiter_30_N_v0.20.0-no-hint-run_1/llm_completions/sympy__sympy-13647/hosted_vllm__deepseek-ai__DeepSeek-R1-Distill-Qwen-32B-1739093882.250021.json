The problem is that the `Matrix.col_insert()` method isn't working as expected after a refactor. The user provided a clear example where inserting columns shifts the identity matrix incorrectly.\n\nFirst, I'll explore the repository structure to understand where the `Matrix` class is defined. From the uploaded files, it looks like the relevant file is `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/matrices/matrices.py`.\n\nNext, I'll create a script to reproduce the error. This will help confirm the issue and later verify the fix. The script will:\n1. Import sympy\n2. Create the identity matrix M\n3. Create the matrix V with all elements as 2\n4. Insert V into M at column 3\n5. Print the result\n\nAfter setting up the reproduce script, I'll examine the `col_insert` method in the Matrix class. The issue likely stems from how the method handles column insertion, particularly after the matrix refactor. I'll need to modify the method to ensure columns are inserted correctly without shifting existing data improperly.\n\nOnce the method is updated, I'll rerun the reproduce script to confirm the fix. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases like inserting at different positions and with varying matrix sizes to ensure robustness.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the changes are minimal and only target the `col_insert` method to avoid introducing new issues elsewhere in the codebase.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by creating a script to reproduce the issue:\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/test_col_insert.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nimport sympy as sm\n\n# Create a 6x6 identity matrix\nM = sm.eye(6)\nprint(\"Original Matrix M:\")\nprint(M)\n\n# Create a 6x2 matrix filled with 2s\nV = 2 * sm.ones(6, 2)\nprint(\"\\nMatrix V to insert:\")\nprint(V)\n\n# Insert V into M at column 3\nresult = M.col_insert(3, V)\nprint(\"\\nResult after insertion:\")\nprint(result)\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nFile created successfully at: /workspace/test_col_insert.py"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-a238cb0f24aa4c2a8784cd2268f492d4", "created": 1739093747, "model": "hosted_vllm/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\nNow, let's run the script to confirm the issue:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\npython3 /workspace/test_col_insert.py\n</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to fix the issue with the Matrix.col_insert() method in SymPy. The user provided an example where inserting a matrix into another shifts the identity matrix incorrectly. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the col_insert method is supposed to work. From the example, when V is inserted into M at column 3, the resulting matrix should have the columns of V inserted at that position, and the rest of the columns should shift accordingly. But in the current implementation, the identity matrix part is shifted up, which is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the code, the col_insert method probably constructs a new matrix by combining the original matrix and the inserted matrix. Maybe the way it's combining them is flawed. Perhaps it's not correctly handling the rows or the order of concatenation.\n\nI'll start by examining the current implementation of col_insert. It might be using some internal methods that were affected by the matrix refactor. If the refactor changed how matrices are stored or accessed, that could explain the issue.\n\nOnce I identify the problematic part, I'll need to adjust the method to correctly insert the columns. This might involve ensuring that the rows are properly aligned when combining the matrices. I should also consider edge cases, like inserting at the beginning or end of the matrix, or inserting an empty matrix.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes, I'll run the reproduce script to test if the issue is resolved. If it works, I'll then think about other test cases to ensure the fix is robust.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 4289, "total_tokens": 4640, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739093882.2500293, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

The user provided a clear example where inserting columns shifts the identity matrix incorrectly.\n\nFirst, I'll explore the repository structure to understand where the `Matrix` class is defined. From the uploaded files, it looks like the relevant file is `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/matrices/matrices.py`.\n\nNext, I'll create a script to reproduce the error. This will help confirm the issue and later verify the fix. The script will:\n1. Import sympy\n2. Create the identity matrix M\n3. Create the matrix V with all elements as 2\n4. Insert V into M at column 3\n5. Print the result\n\nAfter setting up the reproduce script, I'll examine the `col_insert` method in the Matrix class. The issue likely stems from how the method handles column insertion, particularly after the matrix refactor. I'll need to modify the method to ensure columns are inserted correctly without shifting existing data improperly.\n\nOnce the method is updated, I'll rerun the reproduce script to confirm the fix. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases like inserting at different positions and with varying matrix sizes to ensure robustness.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the changes are minimal and only target the `col_insert` method to avoid introducing new issues elsewhere in the codebase.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by creating a script to reproduce the issue:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/test_col_insert.py\", \"file_text\": \"import sympy as sm\\n\\n# Create a 6x6 identity matrix\\nM = sm.eye(6)\\nprint(\\\"Original Matrix M:\\\")\\nprint(M)\\n\\n# Create a 6x2 matrix filled with 2s\\nV = 2 * sm.ones(6, 2)\\nprint(\\\"\\\\nMatrix V to insert:\\\")\\nprint(V)\\n\\n# Insert V into M at column 3\\nresult = M.col_insert(3, V)\\nprint(\\\"\\\\nResult after insertion:\\\")\\nprint(result)\"}"}}]}, {"content": "File created successfully at: /workspace/test_col_insert.py", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "str_replace_editor"}], "fncall_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-a238cb0f24aa4c2a8784cd2268f492d4", "created": 1739093747, "model": "hosted_vllm/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Now, let's run the script to confirm the issue:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 /workspace/test_col_insert.py\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_02", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 4289, "total_tokens": 4640, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
