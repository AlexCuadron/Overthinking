Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The issue is that when a HEAD request is made, the server should return the headers but no body. Currently, runserver is sending the body, which is incorrect. This was changed in Django 1.10, and it's causing problems because some servers handle this correctly, but runserver doesn't.\n\nLooking at the repository structure, I see that the code is in the django__django__5.0 directory. I need to find where the runserver command is handled. I remember that Django's runserver is part of the django.core.management module, specifically in the commands directory. So, the file is likely at django/core/management/commands/runserver.py.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to modify the runserver to strip the response body for HEAD requests. The WSGI server used by runserver is WSGIServer, which is in django/core/servers/basehttp.py. I think the fix involves modifying the server to check if the request method is HEAD and then not send the body.\n\nIn the WSGIServer class, there's a method called handle_one_request that processes each request. I should override this method to check the request method. If it's HEAD, after sending the headers, I should break out of the loop that sends the body.\n\nSo, I'll create a subclass of WSGIServer, say DjangoWSGIServer, and override handle_one_request. In this method, after the headers are sent, I'll check if the method is HEAD. If it is, I'll return early to prevent sending the body.\n\nI'll modify the runserver command to use this new server class instead of the default WSGIServer. This way, when runserver starts, it uses the fixed server that handles HEAD requests correctly.\n\nNow, I need to write the code changes. In runserver.py, I'll import the new server class and set it as the server_class. In basehttp.py, I'll define the new class with the overridden method.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the fix. I can use a script to send a HEAD request and check if the response body is empty. Using curl -I http://localhost:8000 should show the headers without any body.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases, like when the response is streaming or when there's an error. The fix should handle these without introducing new issues. Since the change is in the server handling, it should be robust across different response types.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure to only modify the necessary files and not introduce any unnecessary changes. The goal is a minimal fix that addresses the issue without affecting other parts of the code.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1037, "prompt_tokens": 3751, "total_tokens": 4788, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739085756.493882, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
