By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

The user provided an example where using `header_rows` with the RST format throws an error because the `RST` class doesn't accept the `header_rows` parameter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Astropy repository. The RST writer is located in `astropy/io/ascii/core.py`. I should look at the `RST` class definition there. \n\nIn the initial attempt, I tried to modify the `RST` class by adding the `header_rows` parameter to the `__init__` method and updating the docstring. However, the replacement didn't work because the `old_str` I provided didn't exactly match the content in the file. \n\nI realize that the `old_str` needs to be an exact match, including all whitespace and lines. So, I should check the actual content of `core.py` to ensure that my `old_str` is accurate. \n\nLooking at the file, I notice that the `RST` class might have additional methods or parameters that I didn't account for. For instance, the `__init__` method might have more parameters or different default values. \n\nI should also consider that the `RST` class might have changed in the version provided. Maybe the parameters or the structure of the class is different from what I initially thought. \n\nTo proceed, I'll need to:\n\n1. **View the Current Content**: Use the `str_replace_editor` function with the `view` command to see the exact content of the `RST` class in `core.py`. This will help me craft the correct `old_str` for the replacement.\n\n2. **Adjust the Replacement**: Once I have the exact content, I can modify the `old_str` to include all necessary parts, ensuring that the replacement works.\n\n3. **Test the Changes**: After making the changes, I'll need to test the RST writer with the `header_rows` parameter to ensure it works as expected without errors.\n\nBy carefully matching the `old_str` to the actual file content, I can successfully add the `header_rows` support to the RST writer.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 552, "prompt_tokens": 4434, "total_tokens": 4986, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739078860.8757658, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nI'll help implement support for header rows in the RestructuredText (RST) output of Astropy tables. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Issue**:\n   - The current RST writer doesn't support multiple header rows\n   - The error occurs because `header_rows` parameter isn't handled\n\n2. **Exploring the Repository**:\n   - The RST writer is defined in `astropy/io/ascii/core.py`\n   - We need to modify the `RST` class to support `header_rows`\n\n3. **Planned Changes**:\n   - Add `header_rows` parameter to the RST writer's `__init__`\n   - Modify the `_write_table` method to handle multiple header rows\n   - Ensure proper underline formatting for each header row\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Create a test script to verify the output\n   - Check edge cases like no headers, single header, and multiple headers\n\nLet's implement these changes step by step.\n\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nFirst, let's modify the RST writer to accept the `header_rows` parameter and handle multiple header rows:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/astropy__astropy__5.1/astropy/io/ascii/core.py\", \"old_str\": \"class RST(AsciiWriter):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Write a table in reStructuredText format.\\n\\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    delimiter : str\\n        The delimiter between columns.
