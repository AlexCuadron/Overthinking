The user is encountering an UnboundLocalError in the evalf method when dealing with certain Mul expressions involving Max. The error seems to occur depending on the order of arguments in the Mul expression. \n\nFrom the traceback, the error happens in evalf.py, specifically in the evalf_mul function. The issue arises because the variable 'reprec' is being referenced before it's assigned. Looking at the code, 'reprec' and 'imprec' are defined in several elif clauses, but there's no else clause to handle cases where none of the conditions are met. This can lead to situations where these variables aren't initialized, causing the UnboundLocalError.\n\nThe user suggests adding an else clause that raises a NotImplementedError. This makes sense because it ensures that all possible cases are handled, preventing the error from occurring.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Explore the Repository**: I'll first check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file and understand its context.\n\n2. **Reproduce the Error**: I'll create a script that triggers the issue by creating the problematic Mul expressions and calling evalf() on them.\n\n3. **Modify the Code**: I'll edit evalf.py to add the else clause in the appropriate place, ensuring that any unhandled cases raise a NotImplementedError instead of causing an UnboundLocalError.\n\n4. **Test the Fix**: After making the changes, I'll rerun the script to confirm that the error is resolved.\n\n5. **Check for Edge Cases**: I'll consider other scenarios where similar issues might occur and ensure that the fix handles them appropriately.\n\nLet's start by exploring the repository to locate the necessary files.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nFirst, I'll check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/:\n__init__.py  add.py  alphabets.py  assumptions.py  backend.py  basic.py  benchmarks  cache.py  compatibility.py  containers.py  core.py  coreerrors.py  decorators.py  evalf.py  evaluate.py  expr.py  exprtools.py  facts.py  function.py  logic.py  mod.py  mul.py  multidimensional.py  numbers.py  operations.py  power.py  relational.py  rules.py  singleton.py  symbol.py  sympify.py  tests  trace.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/benchmarks:\n__init__.py  bench_arit.py  bench_assumptions.py  bench_basic.py  bench_expand.py  bench_numbers.py  bench_sympify.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/tests:\n__init__.py  test_args.py  test_arit.py  test_assumptions.py  test_basic.py  test_cache.py  test_compatibility.py  test_complex.py  test_constructor_postprocessor.py  test_containers.py  test_count_ops.py  test_diff.py  test_equal.py  test_eval.py  test_eval_power.py  test_evalf.py  test_evaluate.py  test_expand.py  test_expr.py  test_exprtools.py  test_facts.py  test_function.py  test_logic.py  test_match.py  test_noncommutative.py  test_numbers.py  test_operations.py  test_priority.py  test_relational.py  test_rules.py  test_subs.py  test_symbol.py  test_sympify.py  test_trace.py  test_truediv.py  test_var.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-9d3c787792c74638ae0844be57e33313", "created": 1739093431, "model": "hosted_vllm/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\nTo address the issue, I'll create a script to reproduce the error and then modify the code to fix it.\n\nFirst, let's create a script to reproduce the error.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nfrom sympy import x, y, Max, Mul\n\ndef test_evalf():\n    expr1 = Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False)\n    expr2 = Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False)\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating expr1.evalf():\")\n    print(expr1.evalf())\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating expr2.evalf():\")\n    print(expr2.evalf())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_evalf()\n</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to help fix this issue in the SymPy repository. The problem is an UnboundLocalError occurring in the evalf method when dealing with certain expressions involving Max. The error seems to happen depending on the order of arguments in a multiplication (Mul) expression.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the error is happening. From the traceback, it points to evalf.py, specifically around line 1285 and 1286. The error is that 'reprec' is referenced before assignment, which suggests that in some cases, the code isn't properly initializing these variables.\n\nLooking at the code structure, I see that in evalf.py, there's a function called evalf_mul. This function handles the evaluation of multiplication expressions. Inside this function, there are several elif clauses that set 'reprec' and 'imprec' based on certain conditions. However, if none of these conditions are met, these variables might not be assigned, leading to the UnboundLocalError.\n\nThe user's suggestion is to add an else clause that raises a NotImplementedError. This makes sense because it ensures that all possible cases are handled, preventing the error from occurring when an unexpected case arises.\n\nNow, to proceed, I need to:\n\n1. **Reproduce the Error**: Create a script that triggers the issue. This will help confirm that the problem exists and that my fix works.\n\n2. **Modify the Code**: Edit evalf.py to add the else clause in the evalf_mul function. This will handle any cases that aren't covered by the existing conditions.\n\n3. **Test the Fix**: After making the changes, rerun the script to ensure the error is resolved.\n\n4. **Check for Edge Cases**: Consider other scenarios where similar issues might occur and ensure the fix handles them.\n\nStarting with reproducing the error, I'll write a Python script that creates the problematic Mul expressions and calls evalf() on them. This will help me see if the error occurs as expected.\n\nOnce I've confirmed the error, I'll move on to modifying the code. I'll locate the evalf_mul function in evalf.py and add the else clause after the existing elif statements. This else clause will raise a NotImplementedError, which is a more controlled way to handle unexpected cases.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll rerun the script to see if the error is fixed. If it is, then the fix is successful. If not, I'll need to revisit the code to see if there are other issues or if the else clause needs to be adjusted.\n\nAdditionally, I'll think about other edge cases, such as different types of expressions or argument orders, to ensure that the fix is comprehensive and doesn't introduce new issues.\n\nOverall, the key steps are to reproduce the error, modify the code to handle all cases, test the fix, and verify that it works for various scenarios.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 777, "prompt_tokens": 4476, "total_tokens": 5253, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739093601.3894575, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

This makes sense because it ensures that all possible cases are handled, preventing the error from occurring.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Explore the Repository**: I'll first check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file and understand its context.\n\n2. **Reproduce the Error**: I'll create a script that triggers the issue by creating the problematic Mul expressions and calling evalf() on them.\n\n3. **Modify the Code**: I'll edit evalf.py to add the else clause in the appropriate place, ensuring that any unhandled cases raise a NotImplementedError instead of causing an UnboundLocalError.\n\n4. **Test the Fix**: After making the changes, I'll rerun the script to confirm that the error is resolved.\n\n5. **Check for Edge Cases**: I'll consider other scenarios where similar issues might occur and ensure that the fix handles them appropriately.\n\nLet's start by exploring the repository to locate the necessary files.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nFirst, I'll check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"ls -R /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/\"}"}}]}, {"content": "/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/:\n__init__.py  add.py  alphabets.py  assumptions.py  backend.py  basic.py  benchmarks  cache.py  compatibility.py  containers.py  core.py  coreerrors.py  decorators.py  evalf.py  evaluate.py  expr.py  exprtools.py  facts.py  function.py  logic.py  mod.py  mul.py  multidimensional.py  numbers.py  operations.py  power.py  relational.py  rules.py  singleton.py  symbol.py  sympify.py  tests  trace.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/benchmarks:\n__init__.py  bench_arit.py  bench_assumptions.py  bench_basic.py  bench_expand.py  bench_numbers.py  bench_sympify.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/tests:\n__init__.py  test_args.py  test_arit.py  test_assumptions.py  test_basic.py  test_cache.py  test_compatibility.py  test_complex.py  test_constructor_postprocessor.py  test_containers.py  test_count_ops.py  test_diff.py  test_equal.py  test_eval.py  test_eval_power.py  test_evalf.py  test_evaluate.py  test_expand.py  test_expr.py  test_exprtools.py  test_facts.py  test_function.py  test_logic.py  test_match.py  test_noncommutative.py  test_numbers.py  test_operations.py  test_priority.py  test_relational.py  test_rules.py  test_subs.py  test_symbol.py  test_sympify.py  test_trace.py  test_truediv.py  test_var.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "execute_bash"}], "fncall_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-9d3c787792c74638ae0844be57e33313", "created": 1739093431, "model": "hosted_vllm/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the issue, I'll create a script to reproduce the error and then modify the code to fix it.\n\nFirst, let's create a script to reproduce the error.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py\", \"file_text\": \"from sympy import x, y, Max, Mul\\n\\ndef test_evalf():\\n    expr1 = Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False)\\n    expr2 = Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False)\\n    \\n    print(\\\"Evaluating expr1.evalf():\\\")\\n    print(expr1.evalf())\\n    \\n    print(\\\"Evaluating expr2.evalf():\\\")\\n    print(expr2.evalf())\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    test_evalf()\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_02", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 777, "prompt_tokens": 4476, "total_tokens": 5253, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
