AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The user is encountering an UnboundLocalError in the evalf method when dealing with certain Mul expressions involving Max. The error seems to occur depending on the order of arguments in the Mul expression. \n\nFrom the traceback, the error happens in evalf.py, specifically in the evalf_mul function. The issue arises because the variable 'reprec' is being referenced before it's assigned. Looking at the code, 'reprec' and 'imprec' are defined in several elif clauses, but there's no else clause to handle cases where none of the conditions are met. This can lead to situations where these variables aren't initialized, causing the UnboundLocalError.\n\nThe user suggests adding an else clause that raises a NotImplementedError. This makes sense because it ensures that all possible cases are handled, preventing the error from occurring.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Explore the Repository**: I'll first check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file and understand its context.\n\n2. **Reproduce the Error**: I'll create a script that triggers the issue by creating the problematic Mul expressions and calling evalf() on them.\n\n3. **Modify the Code**: I'll edit evalf.py to add the else clause in the appropriate place, ensuring that any unhandled cases raise a NotImplementedError instead of causing an UnboundLocalError.\n\n4. **Test the Fix**: After making the changes, I'll rerun the script to confirm that the error is resolved.\n\n5. **Check for Edge Cases**: I'll consider other scenarios where similar issues might occur and ensure that the fix handles them appropriately.\n\nLet's start by exploring the repository to locate the necessary files.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nFirst, I'll check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/:\n__init__.py  add.py  alphabets.py  assumptions.py  backend.py  basic.py  benchmarks  cache.py  compatibility.py  containers.py  core.py  coreerrors.py  decorators.py  evalf.py  evaluate.py  expr.py  exprtools.py  facts.py  function.py  logic.py  mod.py  mul.py  multidimensional.py  numbers.py  operations.py  power.py  relational.py  rules.py  singleton.py  symbol.py  sympify.py  tests  trace.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/benchmarks:\n__init__.py  bench_arit.py  bench_assumptions.py  bench_basic.py  bench_expand.py  bench_numbers.py  bench_sympify.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/tests:\n__init__.py  test_args.py  test_arit.py  test_assumptions.py  test_basic.py  test_cache.py  test_compatibility.py  test_complex.py  test_constructor_postprocessor.py  test_containers.py  test_count_ops.py  test_diff.py  test_equal.py  test_eval.py  test_eval_power.py  test_evalf.py  test_evaluate.py  test_expand.py  test_expr.py  test_exprtools.py  test_facts.py  test_function.py  test_logic.py  test_match.py  test_noncommutative.py  test_numbers.py  test_operations.py  test_priority.py  test_relational.py  test_rules.py  test_subs.py  test_symbol.py  test_sympify.py  test_trace.py  test_truediv.py  test_var.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the issue, I'll create a script to reproduce the error and then modify the code to fix it.\n\nFirst, let's create a script to reproduce the error.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nfrom sympy import x, y, Max, Mul\n\ndef test_evalf():\n    expr1 = Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False)\n    expr2 = Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False)\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating expr1.evalf():\")\n    print(expr1.evalf())\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating expr2.evalf():\")\n    print(expr2.evalf())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_evalf()\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nFile created successfully at: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, let's run the script to reproduce the error.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>python3 /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/basic.py:3: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working\n  from collections import Mapping, defaultdict\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/containers.py:271: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working\n  class OrderedSet(collections.MutableSet):\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:3188: SyntaxWarning: \"is\" with a literal.

The user provided a detailed problem description, and I need to figure out how to resolve it. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue is an UnboundLocalError occurring in the evalf method when dealing with certain expressions involving the Max function. Specifically, when the order of arguments in a Mul expression changes, the error appears. The user provided a traceback that points to the evalf_mul function in evalf.py, indicating that 'reprec' is referenced before assignment. This suggests that there's a code path where 'reprec' isn't properly initialized.\n\nThe user's analysis points to the elif clauses in the evalf_mul function not having an else clause to handle unexpected cases, leading to the error. Their proposed solution is to add an else clause that raises a NotImplementedError, which should prevent the UnboundLocalError by ensuring all cases are handled.\n\nNow, looking at the steps I took so far:\n\n1. I explored the repository structure to locate the relevant files, specifically evalf.py.\n2. I created a test script to reproduce the error, but when running it, I encountered an ImportError because 'x' and 'y' weren't imported correctly.\n\nWait, in the test script, I tried importing 'x' and 'y' directly from 'sympy', but that's incorrect. In SymPy, 'x' and 'y' are defined in 'sympy.abc', not directly in 'sympy'. So, the import statement should be adjusted to import 'x' and 'y' from 'sympy.abc'.\n\nLet me correct that. I'll modify the test script to import 'x' and 'y' properly. Once that's fixed, running the script should reproduce the error, allowing me to proceed with debugging.\n\nAfter fixing the import issue, I'll run the script again. If the error still occurs, I'll proceed to modify the evalf.py file as per the user's suggestion. I'll add the else clause in the evalf_mul function to raise a NotImplementedError when none of the conditions are met. This should prevent the UnboundLocalError by ensuring that all possible cases are accounted for.\n\nOnce the code is modified, I'll rerun the test script to confirm that the error is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider other edge cases where similar issues might arise and ensure that the fix handles them appropriately.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n\n- Correct the import statements in the test script.\n- Reproduce the error to confirm the issue.\n- Modify the evalf.py file to add the else clause.\n- Test the fix to ensure the error is resolved.\n- Check for other potential issues to ensure a robust fix.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to address the UnboundLocalError and ensure the evalf method works correctly for the given expressions.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 726, "prompt_tokens": 5200, "total_tokens": 5926, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739093935.7344885, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The user is encountering an UnboundLocalError in the evalf method when dealing with certain Mul expressions involving Max. The error seems to occur depending on the order of arguments in the Mul expression. \n\nFrom the traceback, the error happens in evalf.py, specifically in the evalf_mul function. The issue arises because the variable 'reprec' is being referenced before it's assigned. Looking at the code, 'reprec' and 'imprec' are defined in several elif clauses, but there's no else clause to handle cases where none of the conditions are met. This can lead to situations where these variables aren't initialized, causing the UnboundLocalError.\n\nThe user suggests adding an else clause that raises a NotImplementedError. This makes sense because it ensures that all possible cases are handled, preventing the error from occurring.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Explore the Repository**: I'll first check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file and understand its context.\n\n2. **Reproduce the Error**: I'll create a script that triggers the issue by creating the problematic Mul expressions and calling evalf() on them.\n\n3. **Modify the Code**: I'll edit evalf.py to add the else clause in the appropriate place, ensuring that any unhandled cases raise a NotImplementedError instead of causing an UnboundLocalError.\n\n4. **Test the Fix**: After making the changes, I'll rerun the script to confirm that the error is resolved.\n\n5. **Check for Edge Cases**: I'll consider other scenarios where similar issues might occur and ensure that the fix handles them appropriately.\n\nLet's start by exploring the repository to locate the necessary files.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nFirst, I'll check the structure of the repository to locate the evalf.py file.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"ls -R /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/\"}"}}]}, {"content": "/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/:\n__init__.py  add.py  alphabets.py  assumptions.py  backend.py  basic.py  benchmarks  cache.py  compatibility.py  containers.py  core.py  coreerrors.py  decorators.py  evalf.py  evaluate.py  expr.py  exprtools.py  facts.py  function.py  logic.py  mod.py  mul.py  multidimensional.py  numbers.py  operations.py  power.py  relational.py  rules.py  singleton.py  symbol.py  sympify.py  tests  trace.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/benchmarks:\n__init__.py  bench_arit.py  bench_assumptions.py  bench_basic.py  bench_expand.py  bench_numbers.py  bench_sympify.py\n\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/tests:\n__init__.py  test_args.py  test_arit.py  test_assumptions.py  test_basic.py  test_cache.py  test_compatibility.py  test_complex.py  test_constructor_postprocessor.py  test_containers.py  test_count_ops.py  test_diff.py  test_equal.py  test_eval.py  test_eval_power.py  test_evalf.py  test_evaluate.py  test_expand.py  test_expr.py  test_exprtools.py  test_facts.py  test_function.py  test_logic.py  test_match.py  test_noncommutative.py  test_numbers.py  test_operations.py  test_priority.py  test_relational.py  test_rules.py  test_subs.py  test_symbol.py  test_sympify.py  test_trace.py  test_truediv.py  test_var.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": "To address the issue, I'll create a script to reproduce the error and then modify the code to fix it.\n\nFirst, let's create a script to reproduce the error.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_02", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py\", \"file_text\": \"from sympy import x, y, Max, Mul\\n\\ndef test_evalf():\\n    expr1 = Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False)\\n    expr2 = Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False)\\n    \\n    print(\\\"Evaluating expr1.evalf():\\\")\\n    print(expr1.evalf())\\n    \\n    print(\\\"Evaluating expr2.evalf():\\\")\\n    print(expr2.evalf())\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    test_evalf()\"}"}}]}, {"content": "File created successfully at: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_02", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, {"content": "Now, let's run the script to reproduce the error.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_03", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_evalf.py\"}"}}]}, {"content": "/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/basic.py:3: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working\n  from collections import Mapping, defaultdict\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/core/containers.py:271: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working\n  class OrderedSet(collections.MutableSet):\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:3188: SyntaxWarning: \"is\" with a literal.
