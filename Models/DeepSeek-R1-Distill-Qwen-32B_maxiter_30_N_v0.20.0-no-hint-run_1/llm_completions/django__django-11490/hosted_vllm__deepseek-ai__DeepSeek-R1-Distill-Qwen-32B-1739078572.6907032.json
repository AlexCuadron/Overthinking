The problem is that when using `values()` or `values_list()` on a composed query (like a union), changing the columns after the initial call doesn't work as expected. The root cause seems to be in how the query compiler handles the column selection when the query is composed multiple times.\n\nFirst, I'll start by exploring the repository structure to understand where the relevant code is located. Since the issue points to `compiler.py`, I'll focus on that file, specifically lines 428-433, which handle the column selection logic.\n\nNext, I'll create a script to reproduce the error. This will help confirm that the issue exists and allows me to test the fix once implemented. The script will create a simple model, perform the union operation, and demonstrate the incorrect behavior.\n\nAfter setting up the reproduction script, I'll analyze the code in `compiler.py`. The key issue appears to be that once a query is composed, the column selection isn't properly reset when `values()` or `values_list()` is called again. This means that subsequent calls to these methods don't update the underlying query structure as they should.\n\nTo fix this, I'll modify the query compilation process to ensure that the column selection is reset whenever `values()` or `values_list()` is called on a composed query. This involves updating the relevant methods in `compiler.py` to clear any cached column information when these methods are invoked.\n\nFinally, I'll test the changes by rerunning the reproduction script. If the issue is resolved, the script should now correctly handle changes to the column selection after composition. I'll also consider edge cases, such as multiple unions or different combinations of `values()` calls, to ensure the fix is robust.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure to understand where the relevant code is located. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the contents of the `compiler.py` file.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, I need to help fix this Django issue where composed queries can't change the list of columns when using values() or values_list() multiple times. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user provided an example where after creating a ReservedName object, they create a queryset qs1. When they union qs1 with itself and call values_list('name', 'order'), it returns ('a', 2). But when they change the values_list to ('order'), it still returns ('a', 2) instead of (2,). So the second call isn't respecting the new column order.\n\nLooking at the issue description, it points to compiler.py lines 428-433. I remember that in Django, the query compiler handles how the SQL is generated, especially for annotations and aggregations. The problem might be that once a query is composed, it doesn't update the selected columns correctly when values_list is called again.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure. The uploaded directory is django__django__3.0, so I'll look for the relevant files. Django's ORM code is in django/db/models, and the compiler is in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py.\n\nI need to find where the select clause is being set. In compiler.py, the compile() method builds the SQL query. The select clause is determined by the fields in the queryset. If the query is a union, it might be using the first query's select clause and not updating it when values_list changes.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, I'll create a script that does the steps from the example. I'll write a test script, maybe test_union_values.py, and run it using the execute_bash function. This will help confirm the bug exists as described.\n\nOnce the script reproduces the error, I'll look into the compiler.py file. The issue is likely that the select clause isn't being reset when the queryset is modified. So, when values_list is called again, the compiler isn't updating the select fields.\n\nI think the fix involves modifying the compiler to reset the select clause when the queryset's values or values_list is changed. Maybe in the QuerySet class, there's a way to track if the select clause has been altered, and if so, update it before compiling the query.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in how the union operation handles the select clause. When two queries are unioned, the select fields from the first query are used, and any subsequent changes to the select fields aren't reflected.\n\nI'll check the QuerySet.union method. It might be combining the queries without properly updating the select clause. So, when values_list is called after union, it doesn't update the select fields correctly.\n\nTo fix this, I might need to modify the union method to ensure that the select clause is reset or updated when the queryset's select fields change. This could involve adding a check in the union method to reset the select clause if the fields have changed.\n\nAnother approach is to ensure that each time values_list is called, it updates the query's select clause, even if it's part of a composed query. This might require modifying the QuerySet's values_list method to reset any cached select clauses.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like when multiple unions are performed or when other operations are chained after values_list. The fix should handle these scenarios without introducing new bugs.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to compiler.py or the QuerySet methods, I'll rerun the test script to ensure the issue is resolved. If the second values_list call now returns (2,), the fix is working.\n\nI need to make sure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code. Testing with the provided example and other edge cases will help confirm the fix is correct.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1234, "prompt_tokens": 3345, "total_tokens": 4579, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739078572.690714, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
