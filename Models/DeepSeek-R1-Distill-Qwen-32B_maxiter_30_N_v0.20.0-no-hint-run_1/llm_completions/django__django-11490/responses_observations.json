  "initial_issue": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n\n\nHere's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY!

      "response": "\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that when using `values()` or `values_list()` on a composed query (like a union), changing the columns after the initial call doesn't work as expected. The root cause seems to be in how the query compiler handles the column selection when the query is composed multiple times.\n\nFirst, I'll start by exploring the repository structure to understand where the relevant code is located. Since the issue points to `compiler.py`, I'll focus on that file, specifically lines 428-433, which handle the column selection logic.\n\nNext, I'll create a script to reproduce the error. This will help confirm that the issue exists and allows me to test the fix once implemented. The script will create a simple model, perform the union operation, and demonstrate the incorrect behavior.\n\nAfter setting up the reproduction script, I'll analyze the code in `compiler.py`. The key issue appears to be that once a query is composed, the column selection isn't properly reset when `values()` or `values_list()` is called again. This means that subsequent calls to these methods don't update the underlying query structure as they should.\n\nTo fix this, I'll modify the query compilation process to ensure that the column selection is reset whenever `values()` or `values_list()` is called on a composed query. This involves updating the relevant methods in `compiler.py` to clear any cached column information when these methods are invoked.\n\nFinally, I'll test the changes by rerunning the reproduction script. If the issue is resolved, the script should now correctly handle changes to the column selection after composition. I'll also consider edge cases, such as multiple unions or different combinations of `values()` calls, to ensure the fix is robust.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure to understand where the relevant code is located. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the contents of the `compiler.py` file.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</parameter>\n",

Here's how we'll approach the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Problematic Code**: The issue lies in how the `SQLCompiler` handles the selection of columns when `values()` or `values_list()` is called multiple times. The current implementation doesn't reset the column selection, leading to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Modify the SQLCompiler Class**: We'll add a method to reset the column selection when `values()` or `values_list()` is called. This ensures that each call starts with a fresh selection.\n\n3. **Update the Query Class**: We'll modify the `Query` class to utilize the new reset method whenever `values()` or `values_list()` is invoked, ensuring that the column selection is properly updated.\n\n4. **Test the Changes**: After implementing the changes, we'll test the solution to confirm that the issue is resolved and that edge cases are handled correctly.\n\nLet's start by implementing the necessary changes in the `compiler.py` file.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>def get_select(self):</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>def get_select(self):\n    # Reset the select, klass_info, and annotation_col_map when get_select is called\n    self.select = None\n    self.klass_info = None\n    self.annotation_col_map = None</parameter>\n",
