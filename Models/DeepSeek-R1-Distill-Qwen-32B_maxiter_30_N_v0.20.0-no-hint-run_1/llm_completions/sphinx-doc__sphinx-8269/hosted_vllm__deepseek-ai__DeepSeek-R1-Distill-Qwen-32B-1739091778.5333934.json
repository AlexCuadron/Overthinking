First, let's view the current implementation of `_check_anchors`:\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.3/sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[1, -1]</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, I need to help the user fix the issue where the Sphinx linkcheck reports \"Anchor not found\" instead of the actual HTTP error when linkcheck_anchors is True. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The user provided an issue description where using linkcheck with anchors enabled causes the error message to be about the anchor not being found, rather than the actual HTTP error like 404. The expected behavior is to show the HTTP error instead.\n\nI remember that Sphinx uses the requests library to handle HTTP requests. So, when a link with an anchor is checked, Sphinx makes a request to the URL and then checks if the anchor exists. If the server returns an HTTP error, like 404, the current code might not capture that correctly when anchors are enabled.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the relevant part is likely in the sphinx-build script, specifically in the linkcheck builder. The function that checks the anchors probably doesn't handle HTTP errors properly. I should find where the anchor check happens and modify it to check the response status first.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository. The user provided the path /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.3, so I'll look for the linkcheck-related code. The main file is probably sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py.\n\nIn that file, there's a method called _check_anchors. This method sends a request to the URL and then parses the response to find the anchor. If the server returns an error status code, the current code might not check that and proceeds to look for the anchor, leading to the \"Anchor not found\" message.\n\nSo, the fix should involve modifying the _check_anchors method to first check if the response status is an error. If it is, it should return that error instead of trying to find the anchor.\n\nI'll plan the changes:\n\n1. In the _check_anchors method, after making the request, check if the response status code is not 200. If it's an error, return the appropriate error message.\n2. If the status is 200, proceed to check for the anchor as before.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like redirects. Maybe the response is a redirect, but the final URL returns an error. So, I should check the history of the response as well.\n\nNow, I'll write the code changes. I'll modify the _check_anchors method to include the status code check. If the status is not 200, return the error. Otherwise, proceed with the anchor check.\n\nTesting this change is crucial. I'll create a test script that runs the linkcheck with the problematic URL and checks if the output now shows the HTTP error instead of the anchor issue.\n\nI should also ensure that when linkcheck_anchors is False, the behavior remains unchanged. The fix should only affect the case when anchors are enabled.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure to update the code correctly, handling any exceptions and ensuring that the response is properly checked for errors before proceeding with anchor validation.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1095, "prompt_tokens": 3551, "total_tokens": 4646, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739091778.5334034, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
