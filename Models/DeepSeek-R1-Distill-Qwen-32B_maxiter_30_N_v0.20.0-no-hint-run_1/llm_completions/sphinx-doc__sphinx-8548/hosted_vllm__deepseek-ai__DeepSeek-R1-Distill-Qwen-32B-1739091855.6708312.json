The problem is that autodoc isn't properly handling inherited data members (attributes) when using the `inherited-members` option.

The problem is that when a class inherits from another, the data members (like variables) from the base class aren't being documented, even though the `inherited-members` option is set. \n\nFirst, I should understand how autodoc works. It uses the `inspect` module to get information about classes and their attributes. The issue is that when looking for docstrings, it's only checking the current class's namespace, not the base classes'. So, if a data member is inherited, it's not found because the search doesn't go up the inheritance chain.\n\nI'll start by looking at the relevant part of the code. The `get_doc` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc.py` is responsible for retrieving docstrings. It uses `(namespace, attrname)` as a key. I think the fix involves modifying this function to also check the base classes' namespaces.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify `get_doc` so that if the attribute isn't found in the current namespace, it looks through all base classes recursively. For each base class, it will check if the attribute exists there and use that for the docstring.\n\nI'll need to write a helper function, maybe `get_inherited_doc`, which takes the attribute name and the current object. This function will traverse the inheritance hierarchy, checking each base class's namespace for the attribute. If found, it returns the docstring; otherwise, it continues up the chain.\n\nIn the `get_doc` function, after the initial check, if the attribute isn't found, I'll call `get_inherited_doc`. If that returns a docstring, I'll use it; otherwise, proceed as before.\n\nTesting this change is crucial. I'll create a test script with a base class and a subclass that inherits a data member. Without the fix, autodoc shouldn't show the inherited member, but after applying the fix, it should appear in the documentation.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases, like multiple inheritance levels or attributes that are shadowed in subclasses. The fix should handle all these scenarios by correctly traversing the entire inheritance tree and checking each base class's namespace.\n\nOnce the code is modified, I'll rerun the test script to ensure the inherited data members are now being documented correctly. This should resolve the issue reported in the Bitbucket ticket.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 910, "prompt_tokens": 3329, "total_tokens": 4239, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739091855.6708405, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
