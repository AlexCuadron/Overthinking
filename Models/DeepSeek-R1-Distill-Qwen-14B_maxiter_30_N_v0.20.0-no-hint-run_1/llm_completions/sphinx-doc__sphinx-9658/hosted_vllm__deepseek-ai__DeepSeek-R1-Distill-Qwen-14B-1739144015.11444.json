However, classes which inherit other classes from our own package are ok.\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to be dependent on the `sphinx` version:\r\n\r\n- `sphinx<3.0`: Everything is OK. \r\n- `sphinx>=3.0 < 3.4.2`: Classes that inherit mocked classes are not documented. (see [sphinx #8164](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/8164)). This is fixed in `sphinx 3.4.2`. \r\n- `sphinx>=3.4.2`: The previously missing classes are now documented, but there is a problem with the \"Bases\" section in the docs. \r\n \r\nExample: In the docs for `alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.DeepKernel` in this readthedocs build https://seldon--338.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/338/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html, the base class is listed as \"Bases: `torch.nn.`\" instead of \"Bases: `torch.nn.Module`\". \r\n\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ascillitoe/alibi-detect.git\r\n$ cd alibi-detect\r\n$ pip install -r requirements/docs.txt\r\n$ make build_docs\r\n$ # open doc/_build/html/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html and see \"Bases\" section.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe \"Bases\" section should report `torch.nn.Module` not `torch.nn.`. \r\n\r\ni.e. see\r\nhttps://seldon--325.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/325/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html\r\n\r\n### Your project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ascillitoe/alibi-detect/tree/feature_sphinx4\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Screenshot with `sphinx==4.2`\r\n![sphinx_problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061685/133816582-ca162b07-41c7-4b8e-98ea-781e7c659229.png)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot with `sphinx<3.0`\r\n![sphinx_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061685/133816065-6291ce1b-96cf-4b0f-9648-7f993fc15611.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04 (used by readthedocs/build:6.0)\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.8.11\r\n\r\n### Sphinx version\r\n\r\n`>=3.4.2`\r\n\r\n### Sphinx extensions\r\n\r\n    [\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.doctest\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.intersphinx\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.todo\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.coverage\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.mathjax\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.ifconfig\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.viewcode\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.napoleon\",\r\n    \"sphinx_autodoc_typehints\",\r\n    \"sphinxcontrib.apidoc\", \r\n    \"nbsphinx\",\r\n    \"nbsphinx_link\",  \r\n    \"myst_parser\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra tools\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\ndemo PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect/pull/338\r\n\r\nreadthedocs demo build:\r\nhttps://seldon--338.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/338/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html\r\n\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem occurs when the class inherits from a mocked class, and it's specific to certain versions of Sphinx. Let me break down what I know and how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the issue better. From the description, when using Sphinx versions >=3.4.2, the \"Bases\" section in the documentation is incorrect. For example, instead of showing \"Bases: torch.nn.Module\", it shows \"Bases: torch.nn.\". That's a problem because it's not providing the right information to users.\n\nThe user mentioned that this issue is related to how Sphinx handles mocked classes. Mocking is a way to include documentation for modules that aren't available at build time, which is common in projects that use certain dependencies that might not be installed. So, when a class inherits from a mocked class, Sphinx might not be able to resolve the base class correctly, leading to the incorrect \"Bases\" entry.\n\nI remember that in the past, there were issues with how Sphinx handles inheritance, especially with mocked modules. The user provided a link to a specific issue on the Sphinx GitHub page, which is helpful. It looks like this issue was fixed in version 3.4.2, but perhaps there's a regression or another problem that's causing this specific issue.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to reproduce the problem. The user provided a set of steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and build the documentation. I should follow these steps to see the issue firsthand. This will help me confirm that the problem exists and understand how it's manifesting.\n\nOnce I can reproduce the issue, I need to look into the project's configuration files, especially the `conf.py` in the Sphinx documentation directory. This file is where extensions and other settings are configured. I suspect that the way the project is handling autodoc or how it's mocking modules might be contributing to the problem.\n\nI recall that in some cases, using `autodoc_mock_imports` can help mock certain modules. Maybe the project is mocking too much, including modules that it shouldn't, which is causing the inheritance to be mishandled. Alternatively, perhaps the way the `Bases` are being determined in the documentation is flawed when dealing with mocked classes.\n\nI should check if there are any known workarounds or patches for this issue. Looking at the Sphinx issue linked, I see that the problem was fixed in 3.4.2, but maybe there's a configuration change that can be made to work around this issue if it's still present.\n\nAnother angle is to look at how the classes are defined in the source code. If a class inherits from a mocked class, maybe there's a way to explicitly tell Sphinx about the base classes to ensure they're documented correctly. Perhaps adding a `: Inherits:` directive or something similar in the docstring could help.\n\nI also need to consider if there are any changes in how Sphinx processes inheritance in more recent versions. Maybe the way it resolves base classes has changed, and the project's configuration needs to be updated accordingly.\n\nAfter making any necessary changes, I should rebuild the documentation to see if the issue is resolved. If the \"Bases\" section now correctly shows the inherited classes, then the fix was successful. If not, I'll need to revisit the configuration or look for alternative solutions.\n\nIn summary, my approach is to:\n\n1. Reproduce the issue by following the provided steps.\n2. Examine the project's Sphinx configuration, particularly `conf.py`.\n3. Identify any misconfigurations related to mocking or autodoc.\n4. Implement necessary changes, such as adjusting the mocked modules or adding explicit inheritance in docstrings.\n5. Rebuild the documentation to verify the fix.\n\nI think the key is to ensure that when a class inherits from a mocked module, Sphinx still correctly identifies and documents the base classes. This might involve tweaking how the project mocks modules or providing additional information to Sphinx about the inheritance hierarchy.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nTo address the issue where inherited classes from mocked modules are not correctly documented in Sphinx, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Reproduce the Issue**: I'll execute the provided script to replicate the problem and observe the incorrect \"Bases\" section in the documentation.\n\n2. **Analyze Configuration**: I'll examine the `conf.py` file in the Sphinx documentation directory to understand how autodoc and mocking are configured.\n\n3. **Identify Problematic Configuration**: It appears that the `autodoc_mock_imports` might be too broad, causing issues with class inheritance documentation.\n\n4. **Adjust Configuration**: I'll modify the `autodoc_mock_imports` to exclude modules that are not needed, preventing unnecessary mocking that interferes with inheritance resolution.\n\n5. **Test Changes**: After updating the configuration, I'll rebuild the documentation to verify if the \"Bases\" section now correctly displays the inherited classes.\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo fix the issue, I'll modify the `conf.py` file to adjust the `autodoc_mock_imports` configuration. This change will help Sphinx correctly document the base classes when they are not mocked.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\npython3 reproduce_issue.py\n</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1107, "prompt_tokens": 4046, "total_tokens": 5153, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739144015.1144502, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

The problem occurs when the class inherits from a mocked class, and it's specific to certain versions of Sphinx. Let me break down what I know and how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the issue better. From the description, when using Sphinx versions >=3.4.2, the \"Bases\" section in the documentation is incorrect. For example, instead of showing \"Bases: torch.nn.Module\", it shows \"Bases: torch.nn.\". That's a problem because it's not providing the right information to users.\n\nThe user mentioned that this issue is related to how Sphinx handles mocked classes. Mocking is a way to include documentation for modules that aren't available at build time, which is common in projects that use certain dependencies that might not be installed. So, when a class inherits from a mocked class, Sphinx might not be able to resolve the base class correctly, leading to the incorrect \"Bases\" entry.\n\nI remember that in the past, there were issues with how Sphinx handles inheritance, especially with mocked modules. The user provided a link to a specific issue on the Sphinx GitHub page, which is helpful. It looks like this issue was fixed in version 3.4.2, but perhaps there's a regression or another problem that's causing this specific issue.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to reproduce the problem. The user provided a set of steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and build the documentation. I should follow these steps to see the issue firsthand. This will help me confirm that the problem exists and understand how it's manifesting.\n\nOnce I can reproduce the issue, I need to look into the project's configuration files, especially the `conf.py` in the Sphinx documentation directory. This file is where extensions and other settings are configured. I suspect that the way the project is handling autodoc or how it's mocking modules might be contributing to the problem.\n\nI recall that in some cases, using `autodoc_mock_imports` can help mock certain modules. Maybe the project is mocking too much, including modules that it shouldn't, which is causing the inheritance to be mishandled. Alternatively, perhaps the way the `Bases` are being determined in the documentation is flawed when dealing with mocked classes.\n\nI should check if there are any known workarounds or patches for this issue. Looking at the Sphinx issue linked, I see that the problem was fixed in 3.4.2, but maybe there's a configuration change that can be made to work around this issue if it's still present.\n\nAnother angle is to look at how the classes are defined in the source code. If a class inherits from a mocked class, maybe there's a way to explicitly tell Sphinx about the base classes to ensure they're documented correctly. Perhaps adding a `: Inherits:` directive or something similar in the docstring could help.\n\nI also need to consider if there are any changes in how Sphinx processes inheritance in more recent versions. Maybe the way it resolves base classes has changed, and the project's configuration needs to be updated accordingly.\n\nAfter making any necessary changes, I should rebuild the documentation to see if the issue is resolved. If the \"Bases\" section now correctly shows the inherited classes, then the fix was successful. If not, I'll need to revisit the configuration or look for alternative solutions.\n\nIn summary, my approach is to:\n\n1. Reproduce the issue by following the provided steps.\n2. Examine the project's Sphinx configuration, particularly `conf.py`.\n3. Identify any misconfigurations related to mocking or autodoc.\n4. Implement necessary changes, such as adjusting the mocked modules or adding explicit inheritance in docstrings.\n5. Rebuild the documentation to verify the fix.\n\nI think the key is to ensure that when a class inherits from a mocked module, Sphinx still correctly identifies and documents the base classes. This might involve tweaking how the project mocks modules or providing additional information to Sphinx about the inheritance hierarchy.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nTo address the issue where inherited classes from mocked modules are not correctly documented in Sphinx, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Reproduce the Issue**: I'll execute the provided script to replicate the problem and observe the incorrect \"Bases\" section in the documentation.\n\n2. **Analyze Configuration**: I'll examine the `conf.py` file in the Sphinx documentation directory to understand how autodoc and mocking are configured.\n\n3. **Identify Problematic Configuration**: It appears that the `autodoc_mock_imports` might be too broad, causing issues with class inheritance documentation.\n\n4. **Adjust Configuration**: I'll modify the `autodoc_mock_imports` to exclude modules that are not needed, preventing unnecessary mocking that interferes with inheritance resolution.\n\n5. **Test Changes**: After updating the configuration, I'll rebuild the documentation to verify if the \"Bases\" section now correctly displays the inherited classes.\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo fix the issue, I'll modify the `conf.py` file to adjust the `autodoc_mock_imports` configuration. This change will help Sphinx correctly document the base classes when they are not mocked.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 reproduce_issue.py\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1107, "prompt_tokens": 4046, "total_tokens": 5153, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
