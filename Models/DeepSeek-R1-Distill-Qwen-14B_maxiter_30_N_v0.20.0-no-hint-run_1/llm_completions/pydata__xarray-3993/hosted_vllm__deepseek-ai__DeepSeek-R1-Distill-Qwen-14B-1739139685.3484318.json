By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nDataArray.integrate has a 'dim' arg, but Dataset.integrate has a 'coord' arg\nThis is just a minor gripe but I think it should be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe API syntax is inconsistent:\r\n```python\r\nds.differentiate(coord='x')\r\nda.differentiate(coord='x')\r\nds.integrate(coord='x')\r\nda.integrate(dim='x')   # why dim??\r\n```\r\nIt should definitely be `coord` - IMO it doesn't make sense to integrate or differentiate over a dim because a dim by definition has no information about the distance between grid points. I think because the distinction between dims and coords is one of the things that new users have to learn about, we should be strict to not confuse up the meanings in the documentation/API.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the original PR [seems to agree](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/2653#discussion_r246164990), so I think this was just an small oversight.\r\n\r\nThe only question is whether it requires a deprecation cycle?\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

I need to change that to 'coord'.

This will help verify that the change works as expected without breaking existing functionality.\n\nI'll execute this script using execute_bash to run it in the background and check the output. If it runs without errors and produces the correct result, the change is successful.\n\nI should also consider any potential edge cases, like when 'coord' isn't present or when the method is called without the 'coord' parameter.
