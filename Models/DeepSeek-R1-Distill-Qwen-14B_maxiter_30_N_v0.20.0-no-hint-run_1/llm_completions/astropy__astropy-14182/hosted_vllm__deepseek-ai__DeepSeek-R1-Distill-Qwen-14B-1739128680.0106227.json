The problem is that when using the 'rst' format with header_rows, it throws an error. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the error. The traceback shows a TypeError because the RST writer's __init__ method doesn't expect 'header_rows'. So, the RST writer doesn't handle this parameter.\n\nI remember that in Astropy, different formatters handle parameters differently. The 'fixed_width' format supports header_rows, so maybe I can modify the RST writer to behave similarly.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the RST writer is probably in astropy/io/ascii/rst.py. I'll need to edit that file.\n\nIn the RST writer's __init__ method, I should add handling for header_rows. If header_rows is provided, I'll write those as header rows in the RST table. Also, I should check if the user provided header_rows and units, and handle them appropriately.\n\nI'll modify the __init__ method to accept header_rows and units as keyword arguments. Then, in the _write_table method, I'll add the header rows before the data rows. If units are provided, I'll include them as a second header row.\n\nI should also make sure that if header_rows isn't provided, the original behavior remains. So, I'll check if header_rows is not None before adding them.\n\nTesting is important. The user mentioned they've already handled test files, so I don't need to modify tests. But I should run their reproduce script to confirm the fix.\n\nFinally, I'll create a script that reproduces the error and run it using execute_bash to verify the fix works.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix this issue. First, I need to understand the problem and the code structure.\n\nThe error occurs because the RST writer doesn't support the `header_rows` parameter. Looking at the code, we need to modify the RST writer in `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` to handle this parameter.\n\nThe goal is to make the RST writer accept and properly format `header_rows` similar to how it's done in the `fixed_width` writer.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Modify the RST writer to accept `header_rows` and `units` parameters\n2. Add logic to write header rows before the data rows\n3.

The user is trying to fix an issue in the Astropy repository where the RST writer doesn't support the `header_rows` parameter. They provided a detailed issue description and a step-by-step plan to modify the RST writer in the `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` file.\n\nIn their first attempt, they used the `str_replace_editor` function to edit the file. However, the execution result indicated an error because the specified path `/workspace/astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` doesn't exist. This suggests that the file isn't present in the expected location, which could be due to the repository structure or how the files were uploaded.\n\nI need to figure out the correct path to the RST writer. Since the user mentioned the uploaded directory is `astropy__astropy__5.1`, I should adjust the path accordingly. The correct path should be `/workspace/astropy__astropy__5.1/astropy/io/ascii/rst.py`.\n\nNext, I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function again with the corrected path. I'll ensure that the code modification correctly adds support for `header_rows` and `units` while maintaining backward compatibility. This involves updating the `__init__` method to capture these parameters and modifying the `_write_table` method to include the header rows and units in the output.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll suggest running a test script to verify that the issue is resolved. This script will create a table, write it using the RST format with header rows, and check if the output is correct.

From the user's previous attempts, I see that they tried to modify the `rst.py` file but encountered issues with the `old_str` not matching exactly. This suggests that the `old_str` they provided doesn't exactly match the content in the file, which is crucial for the `str_replace` function to work correctly.\n\nI'll start by viewing the current content of the `rst.py` file to get an accurate picture of what needs to be changed. The user provided the output of the file, which shows that the `RST` class is defined with specific parameters and methods. My goal is to add support for `header_rows` and `units` without breaking existing functionality.\n\nNext, I'll plan the modifications. The `RST` class's `__init__` method needs to accept `header_rows` and `units` as parameters. These should be optional, so I'll add them with default values of `None`. Then, in the `_write_table` method, I'll include logic to write these headers and units before the data rows.

The traceback shows that when trying to use `header_rows` with the RST format, a `TypeError` occurs because the `RST.__init__()` method doesn't recognize the `header_rows` argument. This means the RST writer class isn't designed to handle `header_rows` or `units` parameters.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the RST writer is located in `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py`. The current implementation of the RST class doesn't accept `header_rows` or `units` as parameters. My goal is to modify this class to support these parameters so that the headers and units can be included in the output.\n\nI'll start by examining the existing RST class. It inherits from `FixedWidth` and has a `write` method. The `FixedWidth` class likely handles the basic structure of writing tables, but it doesn't include support for additional headers or units. I need to enhance the RST class to include these features.\n\nTo do this, I'll add `header_rows` and `units` as parameters to the RST class's `__init__` method. Then, I'll modify the table writing logic to include these headers and units before the data rows. I should also ensure that the existing functionality remains intact for users who don't use these new parameters.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the new parameters are optional so that existing code that uses the RST writer without them doesn't break. Additionally, I should handle cases where `header_rows` is provided but `units` isn't, and vice versa.\n\nNext, I'll update the `write` method to include the new headers and units. This involves adding lines to the output before the data rows. I'll also need to adjust the table structure to accommodate these additions, ensuring that the alignment and formatting remain consistent.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll test the updated RST writer to ensure that it correctly handles the new parameters and produces the expected output. I'll also check for any edge cases, such as when `header_rows` contains multiple rows or when `units` are provided but `header_rows` aren't.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, keeping the rest of the library intact.

The problem is that when using the 'rst' format with header_rows, it throws an error. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the error. The traceback shows a TypeError because the RST writer's __init__ method doesn't expect 'header_rows'. So, the RST writer doesn't handle this parameter.\n\nI remember that in Astropy, different formatters handle parameters differently. The 'fixed_width' format supports header_rows, so maybe I can modify the RST writer to behave similarly.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the RST writer is probably in astropy/io/ascii/rst.py. I'll need to edit that file.\n\nIn the RST writer's __init__ method, I should add handling for header_rows. If header_rows is provided, I'll write those as header rows in the RST table.

Then, in the _write_table method, I'll add the header rows before the data rows. If units are provided, I'll include them as a second header row.\n\nI should also make sure that if header_rows isn't provided, the original behavior remains. So, I'll check if header_rows is not None before adding them.\n\nTesting is important. The user mentioned they've already handled test files, so I don't need to modify tests.

The user is trying to fix an issue in the Astropy repository where the RST writer doesn't support the `header_rows` parameter. They provided a detailed issue description and a step-by-step plan to modify the RST writer in the `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` file.\n\nIn their first attempt, they used the `str_replace_editor` function to edit the file.

This suggests that the `old_str` they provided doesn't exactly match the content in the file, which is crucial for the `str_replace` function to work correctly.\n\nI'll start by viewing the current content of the `rst.py` file to get an accurate picture of what needs to be changed. The user provided the output of the file, which shows that the `RST` class is defined with specific parameters and methods. My goal is to add support for `header_rows` and `units` without breaking existing functionality.\n\nNext, I'll plan the modifications. The `RST` class's `__init__` method needs to accept `header_rows` and `units` as parameters. These should be optional, so I'll add them with default values of `None`. Then, in the `_write_table` method, I'll include logic to write these headers and units before the data rows. I'll ensure that if `header_rows` is provided, the headers are written, and if `units` are provided, they're added as well.\n\nI also need to make sure that the changes are backward compatible.

If the error is resolved and the output includes the headers and units correctly, the fix is successful. If not, I'll need to debug and adjust the implementation as necessary.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as empty `header_rows` or `units`, or cases where the number of units doesn't match the number of columns.

The user provided an error traceback and some context about their issue. Let me break down the problem and figure out how to approach the solution.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the error. The traceback shows that when trying to use `header_rows` with the RST format, a `TypeError` occurs because the `RST.__init__()` method doesn't recognize the `header_rows` argument. This means the RST writer class isn't designed to handle `header_rows` or `units` parameters.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the RST writer is located in `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py`. The current implementation of the RST class doesn't accept `header_rows` or `units` as parameters. My goal is to modify this class to support these parameters so that the headers and units can be included in the output.\n\nI'll start by examining the existing RST class. It inherits from `FixedWidth` and has a `write` method. The `FixedWidth` class likely handles the basic structure of writing tables, but it doesn't include support for additional headers or units. I need to enhance the RST class to include these features.\n\nTo do this, I'll add `header_rows` and `units` as parameters to the RST class's `__init__` method. Then, I'll modify the table writing logic to include these headers and units before the data rows. I should also ensure that the existing functionality remains intact for users who don't use these new parameters.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the new parameters are optional so that existing code that uses the RST writer without them doesn't break. Additionally, I should handle cases where `header_rows` is provided but `units` isn't, and vice versa.\n\nNext, I'll update the `write` method to include the new headers and units. This involves adding lines to the output before the data rows. I'll also need to adjust the table structure to accommodate these additions, ensuring that the alignment and formatting remain consistent.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll test the updated RST writer to ensure that it correctly handles the new parameters and produces the expected output. I'll also check for any edge cases, such as when `header_rows` contains multiple rows or when `units` are provided but `header_rows` aren't.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, keeping the rest of the library intact.
