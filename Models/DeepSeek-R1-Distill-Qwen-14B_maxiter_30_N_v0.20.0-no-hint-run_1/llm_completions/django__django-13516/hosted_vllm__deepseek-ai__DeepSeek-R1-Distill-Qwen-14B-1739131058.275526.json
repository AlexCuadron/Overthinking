Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

Test the changes to ensure that output appears in real-time during commands.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nTo resolve the issue where `flush()` doesn't work in Django management commands during migrations, we need to ensure that output is properly flushed to the console. The problem arises because Django's `OutputWrapper` buffers output by default, which can cause delays in seeing progress during long operations.\n\nThe solution involves modifying Django's `OutputWrapper` class to flush output after each write operation. This will ensure that any messages sent during migrations appear immediately, providing real-time feedback.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Modify `OutputWrapper` in `base.py`**:\n   - Update the `write()` method to flush after each write.\n   - Ensure `flush()` properly flushes both `stdout` and `stderr`.\n\n2. **Test the changes**:\n   - Create a test management command that outputs progress during a simulated long operation.\n   - Verify that output appears immediately.\n\n3. **Consider edge cases**:\n   - Ensure that flushing doesn't introduce performance issues.\n   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing commands.\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify Django's `OutputWrapper` class to ensure output is flushed immediately.

Test the changes to ensure that output appears in real-time during commands.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nTo resolve the issue where `flush()` doesn't work in Django management commands during migrations, we need to ensure that output is properly flushed to the console. The problem arises because Django's `OutputWrapper` buffers output by default, which can cause delays in seeing progress during long operations.\n\nThe solution involves modifying Django's `OutputWrapper` class to flush output after each write operation. This will ensure that any messages sent during migrations appear immediately, providing real-time feedback.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Modify `OutputWrapper` in `base.py`**:\n   - Update the `write()` method to flush after each write.\n   - Ensure `flush()` properly flushes both `stdout` and `stderr`.\n\n2. **Test the changes**:\n   - Create a test management command that outputs progress during a simulated long operation.\n   - Verify that output appears immediately.\n\n3. **Consider edge cases**:\n   - Ensure that flushing doesn't introduce performance issues.\n   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing commands.\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify Django's `OutputWrapper` class to ensure output is flushed immediately.
