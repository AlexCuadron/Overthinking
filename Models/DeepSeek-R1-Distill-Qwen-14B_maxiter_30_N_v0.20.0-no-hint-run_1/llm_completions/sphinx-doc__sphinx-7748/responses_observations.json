      "response": "Okay, I need to help the user fix an issue with their Sphinx repository. The problem is that when using SWIG to wrap C++ classes in Python, overloaded methods aren't all showing up in the docstrings. Right now, only the first signature is picked up by `autodoc_docstring_signature`.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how the current code handles docstrings. I remember that in autodoc, there's a callback called `autodoc_docstring_signature` which processes the docstrings to extract function signatures. The issue is that it's only taking the first line, so I need to modify it to collect all signatures.\n\nI'll start by looking at the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module. The function `autodoc_docstring_signature` is probably where the problem lies. I need to change this function to iterate over all lines in the docstring and collect any that look like method signatures.\n\nNext, I should think about how to detect method signatures. Typically, they start with something like \"Args:\" or \"Returns:\", but for methods, they might be in the form of \"def method_name(...):\". I'll need a regular expression that can match these patterns.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like different indentation levels or variations in how the signatures are written. The regex needs to be robust enough to handle these.\n\nOnce I've modified the function to collect all signatures, I'll need to test it. I'll create a test script that uses SWIG to wrap a C++ class with overloaded methods and then generates the documentation to see if all signatures are included.\n\nI should also check if there are any other parts of the code that might be affected by this change. For example, if other parts of the documentation rely on the old behavior, I need to ensure they still work as expected.\n\nFinally, I'll update the Sphinx repository with the new function and test it to make sure the issue is resolved.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you implement the changes to handle overloaded methods in docstrings. First, I need to understand the structure of the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1 repository and the current implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature`.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository structure:\n\n1. The repository contains Sphinx source files in `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1` directory\n2. We need to modify the `autodoc` extension to handle multiple signatures in docstrings\n\nHere's my plan:\n1. First, let me create a test case to demonstrate the issue\n2. Then, I'll modify the `autodoc_docstring_signature` function to handle multiple signatures\n3. Finally, I'll test the changes to ensure it works as expected\n\nLet me create a test script first:\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\npython3 -c \"\nfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc import autodoc_docstring_signature\nimport re\n\ndocstring = '''Args:\ndef method1():\n    pass\ndef method2():\n    pass\n'''\n\n signatures = autodoc_docstring_signature(docstring, None)\n print(signatures)\n\"\n</parameter>\n",

In Python, the code block inside `-c` needs to be correctly indented if it's a multi-line string. The current script has the `signatures = ...` line at the same level as the outer string, which causes an IndentationError.\n\nTo fix this, I'll adjust the script so that the code inside the string is properly indented. I'll add four spaces before the lines inside the `python3 -c` command to ensure it's correctly formatted. This should resolve the IndentationError and allow the script to run without issues.\n\nOnce the script runs successfully, I can then proceed to modify the `autodoc_docstring_signature` function to handle multiple method signatures in the docstring.

The import statements and the rest of the code should be at the same level without any leading spaces.\n\nSo, the problem is that the code inside the quotes is indented, which is causing the IndentationError.

The script is throwing a `SyntaxError` due to an incomplete triple-quoted string. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why the error is happening. Looking at the script, the triple-quoted string for `docstring` starts with '''Args: and includes two function definitions. However, the string isn't properly closed before the assignment of `signatures`. This causes Python to think the string continues indefinitely, leading to a syntax error.\n\nTo fix this, I should ensure that the triple-quoted string is properly closed. I'll add a closing ''' before the `signatures` line. Also, I'll format the script so that each line is correctly indented and doesn't cause any syntax issues.\n\nOnce the script is corrected, I can run it again to see if the function returns both method signatures.

If not, I'll need to look into modifying the `autodoc_docstring_signature` function to support multiple signatures, but that's for the next step.\n\nFor now, the main goal is to get the test script working correctly so that we can verify the function's behavior once we make the necessary changes.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nLet me fix the triple quoted string formatting issue:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\npython3 -c \"\nfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc import autodoc_docstring_signature\nimport re\n\ndocstring = '''Args:\ndef method1():\n    pass\ndef method2():\n    pass\n'''\n\nsignatures = autodoc_docstring_signature(docstring, None)\nprint(signatures)\n\"\n</parameter>\n",

The user provided some context and a test script, but the test is failing with an ImportError. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out why the ImportError is happening. The error message says that 'autodoc_docstring_signature' can't be imported from 'sphinx.ext.autodoc'. Maybe the function isn't available in the version of Sphinx they're using. I should check the Sphinx documentation or source code to see if this function exists.\n\nLooking at the Sphinx source, I see that autodoc_docstring_signature is indeed a function in autodoc.py. So why isn't it importing? Perhaps the way it's being imported is incorrect. In the test script, it's trying to import it directly, but maybe it's not exposed properly.\n\nWait, maybe the function is not meant to be used directly. Perhaps it's an internal function. That would explain why importing it is causing issues. If that's the case, I need to find another way to access it or modify the code without relying on this function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test script is not set up correctly. The user is trying to run it as a standalone Python command, but perhaps the environment isn't set up with the necessary Sphinx modules. They might need to run it from within the Sphinx build environment or install the local Sphinx package.\n\nI should suggest that the user install the local Sphinx package so that the test script can access the autodoc module correctly. They can do this by running 'pip install -e .' in the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1 directory. This way, the test script will use the installed version of Sphinx and the import should work.\n\nOnce the import issue is resolved, the next step is to modify the autodoc_docstring_signature function to handle multiple method signatures. The current implementation probably stops after finding the first one. I'll need to adjust it to collect all signatures.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like when there are no signatures or when the docstring format varies. Making sure the function is robust enough to handle different scenarios is important.\n\nAfter making the changes, the user should rerun their test script to confirm that all signatures are captured. If it works, then the issue is resolved. If not, further debugging might be needed to ensure the function is correctly processing the docstrings.\n\nOverall, the key steps are: fix the import issue by installing the local Sphinx package, modify the function to collect all signatures, and test thoroughly to handle various cases.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nI see the issue - we need to modify the `autodoc` extension to properly handle multiple method signatures in docstrings.

Since the repository is named `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1`, the structure might be a bit different. Perhaps the `autodoc.py` is inside `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py`, but the user's attempt to access it resulted in an error, indicating the path might be incorrect.\n\nI should suggest verifying the exact location of `autodoc.py` within the repository. Maybe the directory structure is different, or the filename is slightly different. Once the correct path is identified, the user can view the source code and proceed with the necessary modifications.\n\nAdditionally, since the test script is failing due to an ImportError, it's possible that the `autodoc` module isn't properly installed or the Python environment isn't set up correctly. The user might need to install Sphinx or ensure the correct Python path is used.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n\n1. Verify the correct path to `autodoc.py` in the repository.\n2. Ensure the Python environment has access to the `autodoc` module.\n3. Once the source code is accessible, modify the `autodoc_docstring_signature` function to handle multiple method signatures.\n4.

      "response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a task where they need to modify the Sphinx documentation to handle overloaded methods in docstrings when using SWIG-wrapped C++ classes. The issue is that the current `autodoc_docstring_signature` function only picks up the first method signature, and the user wants it to capture all of them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the repository. The user mentioned that the repository is in the directory `/workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1`. I should check if the `autodoc.py` file exists there. From the previous attempts, it seems there were errors indicating the file wasn't found, so I need to confirm the correct path.\n\nNext, I'll attempt to locate the `autodoc.py` file using the `str_replace_editor` function with the `view` command. This will help me verify the exact location and ensure I'm working with the right file.\n\nOnce I have the correct path, I'll need to review the current implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature`. This function is responsible for extracting method signatures from docstrings. The goal is to modify it so that it can handle multiple signatures, especially in the context of SWIG-generated docstrings for overloaded methods.\n\nI'll plan to adjust the regular expression used in `autodoc_docstring_signature` to capture all method signatures rather than just the first one. This might involve changing the regex pattern to find all occurrences of the method signature format in the docstring.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes, I'll test the updated function by running a test script. This script will simulate a docstring with multiple method signatures and check if `autodoc_docstring_signature` returns all of them. If the test passes, it means the function now correctly handles overloaded methods.\n\nI also need to ensure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, as per the user's instructions. No modifications to test files are required since the user has already handled that aspect.\n\nFinally, I'll document the changes made and ensure that edge cases, such as varying indentation or different docstring formats, are handled correctly.
