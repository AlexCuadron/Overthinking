The problem is that when a class inherits from two base classes with pytest markers, only one marker is applied, not both. The user provided a code example where TestDings inherits from Foo and Bar, each marked with @pytest.mark.foo and @pytest.mark.bar. Without a custom metaclass, only the foo marker is applied, but with the metaclass, both are collected.\n\nFirst, I should understand how pytest handles markers. Pytest uses the pytestmark attribute to collect markers. By default, when a class inherits from multiple classes, the pytestmark is taken from the last class in the MRO, which is why only one marker is applied.\n\nThe user's approach uses a custom metaclass (BaseMeta) that collects markers from all classes in the MRO. This seems like the right direction. The metaclass's pytestmark property gathers the _pytestmark from each class in the MRO and combines them.\n\nNow, I need to figure out where in the pytest source code this should be implemented. Looking at the provided repository structure, the main file to modify is probably metaclass.py, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll assume that the metaclass is part of pytest's internal handling of marks.\n\nI'll create a script to reproduce the issue. The script will define the base classes with and without the custom metaclass and run some tests to see if both markers are applied. This will help confirm the problem exists.\n\nNext, I'll modify the relevant part of the pytest source code. I'll add the custom metaclass logic to the base class handling. This involves overriding the __getattr__ method to compute the pytestmark from the MRO.\n\nAfter making the changes, I'll rerun the reproduction script to ensure both markers are now present on the TestDings class. I'll also think about edge cases, like when a class has multiple levels of inheritance or when markers are added dynamically.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the changes into a patch file and apply it to the repository. I'll make sure to test thoroughly to avoid introducing new issues.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me analyze the issue and propose a solution:\n\nThe problem occurs when a test class inherits from multiple base classes with pytest markers. Due to Python's MRO (Method Resolution Order), only the last class in the MRO contributes its markers by default. The provided solution uses a custom metaclass to collect markers from all classes in the MRO.\n\nTo implement this in the pytest codebase:\n\n1. We need to modify the `Base` class in `metaclass.py` to use the custom metaclass\n2. The metaclass will override `pytestmark` to collect markers from the entire MRO\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. First, let's create a test script to reproduce the issue:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom .metaclass import Base\n\n@pytest.mark.foo\nclass Foo(Base):\n    pass\n\n@pytest.mark.bar\nclass Bar(Base):\n    pass\n\nclass TestDings(Foo, Bar):\n    def test_dings(self):\n        pass\n```\n\n2.

However, I'd argue that it would be more intuitive to attempt to merge marker values into one, possibly deduplicating marker names by MRO.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport itertools\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nclass BaseMeta(type):\r\n    @property\r\n    def pytestmark(self):\r\n        return (\r\n            getattr(self, \"_pytestmark\", []) +\r\n            list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(getattr(x, \"_pytestmark\", []) for x in self.__mro__))\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    @pytestmark.setter\r\n    def pytestmark(self, value):\r\n        self._pytestmark = value\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Base(object):\r\n    # Without this metaclass, foo and bar markers override each other, and test_dings\r\n    # will only have one marker\r\n    # With the metaclass, test_dings will have both\r\n    __metaclass__ = BaseMeta\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.foo\r\nclass Foo(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.bar\r\nclass Bar(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass TestDings(Foo, Bar):\r\n    def test_dings(self):\r\n        # This test should have both markers, foo and bar.\r\n        # In practice markers are resolved using MRO (so foo wins), unless the\r\n        # metaclass is applied\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect `foo` and `bar` to be markers for `test_dings`, but this only actually is the case with this metaclass.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the repro case is Python 2/3 compatible excluding how metaclasses are added to `Base` (this needs to be taken care of to repro this issue on pytest 6)\nFix missing marks when inheritance from multiple classes\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits.

The problem is that when a class inherits from two base classes with pytest markers, only one marker is applied, not both. The user provided a code example where TestDings inherits from Foo and Bar, each marked with @pytest.mark.foo and @pytest.mark.bar. Without a custom metaclass, only the foo marker is applied, but with the metaclass, both are collected.\n\nFirst, I should understand how pytest handles markers. Pytest uses the pytestmark attribute to collect markers. By default, when a class inherits from multiple classes, the pytestmark is taken from the last class in the MRO, which is why only one marker is applied.\n\nThe user's approach uses a custom metaclass (BaseMeta) that collects markers from all classes in the MRO. This seems like the right direction. The metaclass's pytestmark property gathers the _pytestmark from each class in the MRO and combines them.\n\nNow, I need to figure out where in the pytest source code this should be implemented. Looking at the provided repository structure, the main file to modify is probably metaclass.py, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll assume that the metaclass is part of pytest's internal handling of marks.\n\nI'll create a script to reproduce the issue. The script will define the base classes with and without the custom metaclass and run some tests to see if both markers are applied. This will help confirm the problem exists.\n\nNext, I'll modify the relevant part of the pytest source code. I'll add the custom metaclass logic to the base class handling. This involves overriding the __getattr__ method to compute the pytestmark from the MRO.\n\nAfter making the changes, I'll rerun the reproduction script to ensure both markers are now present on the TestDings class. I'll also think about edge cases, like when a class has multiple levels of inheritance or when markers are added dynamically.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the changes into a patch file and apply it to the repository. I'll make sure to test thoroughly to avoid introducing new issues.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me analyze the issue and propose a solution:\n\nThe problem occurs when a test class inherits from multiple base classes with pytest markers. Due to Python's MRO (Method Resolution Order), only the last class in the MRO contributes its markers by default. The provided solution uses a custom metaclass to collect markers from all classes in the MRO.\n\nTo implement this in the pytest codebase:\n\n1. We need to modify the `Base` class in `metaclass.py` to use the custom metaclass\n2. The metaclass will override `pytestmark` to collect markers from the entire MRO\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. First, let's create a test script to reproduce the issue:\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom .metaclass import Base\n\n@pytest.mark.foo\nclass Foo(Base):\n    pass\n\n@pytest.mark.bar\nclass Bar(Base):\n    pass\n\nclass TestDings(Foo, Bar):\n    def test_dings(self):\n        pass\n```\n\n2. Now let's modify the Base class to use our custom metaclass:\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/src/_pytest/mark/base.py\", \"old_str\": \"class Base(object):\\n    pass\", \"new_str\": \"class Base(object):\\n    __metaclass__ = BaseMeta\\n\\n    @property\\n    def pytestmark(self):\\n        return (\\n            getattr(self, \\\"_pytestmark\\\", []) +\\n            list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(getattr(x, \\\"_pytestmark\\\", []) for x in self.__mro__))\\n        )\\n\\n    @pytestmark.setter\\n    def pytestmark(self, value):\\n        self._pytestmark = value\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 816, "prompt_tokens": 4440, "total_tokens": 5256, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
