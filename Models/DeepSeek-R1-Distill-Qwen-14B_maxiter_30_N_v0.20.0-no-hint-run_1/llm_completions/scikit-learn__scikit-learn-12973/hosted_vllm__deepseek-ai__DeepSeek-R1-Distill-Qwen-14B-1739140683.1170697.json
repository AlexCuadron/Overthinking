Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nLassoLarsIC: unintuitive copy_X behaviour\nHi, I would like to report what seems to be a bug in the treatment of the `copy_X` parameter of the `LassoLarsIC` class. Because it's a simple bug, it's much easier to see in the code directly than in the execution, so I am not posting steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, LassoLarsIC accepts a copy_X parameter.\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7389dbac82d362f296dc2746f10e43ffa1615660/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py#L1487\r\n\r\nHowever, it also takes a copy_X parameter a few lines below, in the definition of ```fit```.\r\n    ```def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):```\r\n\r\nNow there are two values (potentially contradicting each other) for copy_X and each one is used once. Therefore ```fit``` can have a mixed behaviour. Even worse, this can be completely invisible to the user, since copy_X has a default value of True. Let's assume that I'd like it to be False, and have set it to False in the initialization, `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`. I then call ```my_lasso.fit(X, y)``` and my choice will be silently overwritten. \r\n\r\nIdeally I think that copy_X should be removed as an argument in ```fit```. No other estimator seems to have a duplication in class parameters and fit arguments (I've checked more than ten in the linear models module). However, this would break existing code. Therefore I propose that ```fit``` takes a default value of `None` and only overwrites the existing value if the user has explicitly passed it as an argument to ```fit```. I will submit a PR to that effect.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem is that the class has two places where copy_X is defined, leading to unexpected behavior. Let me break down the steps I should take.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the repository. The user mentioned the directory is scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21. I'll need to navigate there to make changes. So, I'll use the execute_bash function to run 'pwd' and 'ls' to confirm I'm in the right place.\n\nNext, I need to look at the code in least_angle.py where LassoLarsIC is defined. The issue is that the class initializes copy_X, but the fit method also has its own copy_X parameter. This duplication causes the user's setting to be overridden when fit is called. My goal is to modify the fit method so that it doesn't override the class's copy_X unless explicitly provided.\n\nI'll edit the fit method's signature. Instead of having a default copy_X=True, I'll set it to None. Then, in the method, I'll check if copy_X is None. If it is, I'll use the instance's copy_X attribute. This way, the fit method won't change the default behavior unless the user explicitly passes a value.\n\nI should also add a docstring to the fit method to explain this behavior, ensuring it's clear how copy_X is handled now.\n\nAfter making these changes, I need to test them. I'll create a Python script that initializes LassoLarsIC with copy_X=False and tries to fit. If the issue is fixed, the copy_X should remain False during fitting. I'll run this script using execute_bash to confirm the behavior.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like when copy_X is set to True in the class but False in fit, or vice versa. The new logic should respect the class's setting unless explicitly changed in fit.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, without altering any tests since the user has already handled that.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix this issue.

The problem is that the class initializes with a `copy_X` parameter, but the `fit` method also has its own `copy_X` argument, which can override the initial value. This leads to unexpected behavior for users.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the current code structure. The `LassoLarsIC` class is defined in `least_angle.py`. The class constructor (`__init__`) accepts `copy_X` as a parameter, and the `fit` method also has `copy_X=True` as a parameter. This duplication is causing the issue because the `fit` method's default can override the user's choice from the constructor.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the `fit` method so that it doesn't override the `copy_X` value set during initialization unless the user explicitly provides a different value when calling `fit`. \n\nOne approach is to set the `copy_X` parameter in the `fit` method to `None` by default. Then, in the method, I'll check if `copy_X` is `None`. If it is, I'll use the value from the class instance (`self.copy_X`). If it's not `None`, I'll use the provided value, but only if it's a boolean. This ensures that the constructor's value is respected unless the user explicitly changes it.\n\nI'll also need to update the method's docstring to reflect this change, so that the documentation accurately describes the behavior.\n\nNow, I'll make the necessary changes to the `fit` method in `least_angle.py`. I'll modify the method signature to have `copy_X=None` and add the logic to handle the `None` case. This way, the `fit` method won't override the initial `copy_X` value unless explicitly told to do so.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test to ensure that the behavior is as expected. If a user sets `copy_X=False` in the constructor and doesn't provide it in `fit`, the value should remain `False`. If they provide `copy_X=True` in `fit`, it should override the constructor's value. If they don't provide it, it should use the constructor's value.\n\nThis approach maintains backward compatibility while fixing the issue, ensuring that the `copy_X` parameter behaves as intended without breaking existing code that relies on the previous behavior.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nI understand the issue. The `LassoLarsIC` class has inconsistent `copy_X` handling between its `__init__` and `fit` methods.

The problem is that the class initializes with a `copy_X` parameter, but the `fit` method also has its own `copy_X` argument, which can override the initial value. This leads to unexpected behavior for users.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the current code structure. The `LassoLarsIC` class is defined in `least_angle.py`. The class constructor (`__init__`) accepts `copy_X` as a parameter, and the `fit` method also has `copy_X=True` as a parameter. This duplication is causing the issue because the `fit` method's default can override the user's choice from the constructor.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the `fit` method so that it doesn't override the `copy_X` value set during initialization unless the user explicitly provides a different value when calling `fit`. \n\nOne approach is to set the `copy_X` parameter in the `fit` method to `None` by default. Then, in the method, I'll check if `copy_X` is `None`. If it is, I'll use the value from the class instance (`self.copy_X`). If it's not `None`, I'll use the provided value, but only if it's a boolean. This ensures that the constructor's value is respected unless the user explicitly changes it.\n\nI'll also need to update the method's docstring to reflect this change, so that the documentation accurately describes the behavior.\n\nNow, I'll make the necessary changes to the `fit` method in `least_angle.py`. I'll modify the method signature to have `copy_X=None` and add the logic to handle the `None` case. This way, the `fit` method won't override the initial `copy_X` value unless explicitly told to do so.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test to ensure that the behavior is as expected. If a user sets `copy_X=False` in the constructor and doesn't provide it in `fit`, the value should remain `False`. If they provide `copy_X=True` in `fit`, it should override the constructor's value. If they don't provide it, it should use the constructor's value.\n\nThis approach maintains backward compatibility while fixing the issue, ensuring that the `copy_X` parameter behaves as intended without breaking existing code that relies on the previous behavior.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nI understand the issue. The `LassoLarsIC` class has inconsistent `copy_X` handling between its `__init__` and `fit` methods. Let's fix this by modifying the `fit` method to respect the `copy_X` value set during initialization unless explicitly overridden.\n\nHere are the changes needed:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py\", \"old_str\": \"def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):\", \"new_str\": \"def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=None):\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Fit the model using X and y as training data.\\n        \\n        Parameters\\n        ----------\\n        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)\\n            Training data.\\n        y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)\\n            Target values.\\n        copy_X : bool, default None\\n            If None, use the value from the initializer.
