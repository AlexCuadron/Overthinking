AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, I need to help the user fix an issue in their Django repository. The problem is that when using ModelAdmin, the error message for readonly_fields doesn't include the field name, making it harder to understand. The user has already taken care of the tests, so I don't need to modify those. My task is to make minimal changes to the non-test files in the repository.\n\nFirst, I should understand the issue better. The error message currently says something like \"The value of 'readonly_fields[0]' is not a callable...\" but it doesn't mention which field caused the problem. The user wants the field's name included to make debugging easier.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository structure. The uploaded file is django__django__5.0, which I assume is the Django source code. I'll need to find where the ModelAdmin checks are happening. In Django, ModelAdmin validation is handled in the admin module, probably in the models.py or options.py files.\n\nLooking through the Django source, I remember that the checks for ModelAdmin options like readonly_fields, list_display, etc., are in the options.py file. Specifically, there's a function called validate() that checks these fields. The error messages are constructed there.\n\nI need to find where the error message for readonly_fields is built. In the validate() function, each option is checked. For readonly_fields, it's checked in the validate_readonly_fields() method. The error is raised without including the field name.\n\nSo, I'll need to modify this part of the code. Instead of just stating the index, I should include the field name in the error message. That means when a field in readonly_fields isn't valid, the error should say something like \"The value 'field_name' in 'readonly_fields' is not a callable...\".\n\nI'll look for the exact line where the error is raised. It's likely in the validate_readonly_fields() method. I'll add the field name to the error message string.\n\nNext, I need to test this change. The user mentioned creating a script to reproduce the error. I'll write a simple Django app that defines a ModelAdmin with a readonly_fields that has an invalid field. Then, I'll run the script to see the error message before and after the change.\n\nAfter making the code change, I'll rerun the script to ensure the error message now includes the field name. I'll also check other similar options like list_editable to make sure the same fix applies and that the error messages for them also include field names if necessary.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as when the field name is long or when multiple fields are invalid. The error message should handle these gracefully, perhaps by truncating long names or displaying multiple errors clearly.\n\nFinally, I'll prepare the code change by editing the relevant file in the Django source. I'll make sure to only modify the necessary parts and keep the rest of the code intact to avoid introducing new issues.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix this issue.

From the issue description, it seems the error occurs during the validation of ModelAdmin attributes. Specifically, the readonly_fields check is failing, and the error message isn't providing enough context.\n\nI'll start by looking into the Django source code, particularly the ModelAdmin class in options.py. The validation logic for readonly_fields is likely located there.

Currently, it seems the message only mentions the index of the invalid field, not the field name itself. My task is to modify this message to include the field name.\n\nI'll also need to ensure that this change doesn't break existing functionality or introduce new issues. Testing will be crucial here. I'll create a test script to reproduce the error and verify that the fix works as expected.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to the source code, I'll rerun the test script to confirm that the error message now includes the field name. If everything looks good, I'll proceed to document the changes and ensure they're properly integrated into the Django repository.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as when multiple fields are invalid or when the invalid field is part of a larger structure.

I'll search for where the error is raised when readonly_fields contains an invalid value.\n\nOnce I locate the validation code, I'll see how the error message is constructed. Currently, it seems the message only mentions the index of the invalid field, not the field name itself. My task is to modify this message to include the field name.\n\nI'll also need to ensure that this change doesn't break existing functionality or introduce new issues. Testing will be crucial here. I'll create a test script to reproduce the error and verify that the fix works as expected.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to the source code, I'll rerun the test script to confirm that the error message now includes the field name. If everything looks good, I'll proceed to document the changes and ensure they're properly integrated into the Django repository.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as when multiple fields are invalid or when the invalid field is part of a larger structure. The fix should handle these scenarios gracefully, providing clear and helpful error messages in all cases.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nLet me help you fix this issue. First, I need to understand the problem and the code structure.\n\nThe issue is about improving error messages in Django's ModelAdmin when validating `readonly_fields`. The current error message doesn't include the field name, making it harder to identify which field is causing the problem.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the Django source code structure. From the uploaded files, I can see the Django repository is in `/workspace/django__django__5.0`.\n\nThe key files I'll need to look at are:\n- `django/core/management/commands/makemessages.py`\n- `django/contrib/admin/options.py` (contains ModelAdmin validation logic)\n\nLet me create a test case to reproduce the error:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 -c \\\"\\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\\nclass MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):\\n    readonly_fields = ['invalid_field']\\nprint(MyModelAdmin.readonly_fields)\\n\\\"\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_02", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 563, "prompt_tokens": 3668, "total_tokens": 4231, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
