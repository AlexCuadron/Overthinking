By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

For example, `f(g(2))` returns `f(g(2))` instead of 4.0. The problem lies in `Function._eval_evalf`, which isn't calling `evalf` on the result of `_imp_`.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure.

I'll create a Python script that demonstrates the issue. This script will import the necessary functions and replicate the example. Running this script using `execute_bash` will show the problem.\n\nOnce I can reproduce the issue, I'll look into the `Function._eval_evalf` method. The goal is to modify it so that after calling `_imp_`, it checks if the result is a SymPy expression and, if so, calls `evalf` on it.\n\nI'll edit the source file to add this logic.

When `f(2).evalf()` and `g(2).evalf()` are called, they return the correct results. However, when `f(g(2)).evalf()` is called, it doesn't evaluate and just returns `f(g(2))` as a string. This indicates that the `evalf` method isn't properly handling the composition of implemented functions.\n\nI remember that in SymPy, `evalf` is used to evaluate expressions numerically. The issue seems to be in the `_eval_evalf` method of the `Function` class, which isn't recursively calling `evalf` on the result of `_imp_`. \n\nFirst, I'll need to locate the relevant file in the repository. From the directory structure, it looks like the SymPy code is in `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy`. The `Function` class is likely in the `sympy/core/function.py` file.\n\nI'll modify the `_eval_evalf` method to ensure that after calling `_imp_`, it recursively calls `evalf` on the result. This should make sure that any composed functions are properly evaluated.\n\nHere's the specific change I'll make:\n\n```python\ndef _eval_evalf(self, **kwargs):\n    from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n    if self._imp_ is not None:\n        result = self._imp_(*[arg._evalf(**kwargs) for arg in self.args])\n        return result._evalf(**kwargs)\n    return self.func(*[arg._evalf(**kwargs) for arg in self.args])\n```\n\nThis change checks if `_imp_` is available, uses it to evaluate the arguments, and then calls `evalf` on the result. If `_imp_` isn't available, it falls back to the default behavior.\n\nNow, I'll apply this change to the `function.py` file.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/core/function.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>def _eval_evalf(self, **kwargs):</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>\ndef _eval_evalf(self, **kwargs):\n    from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n    if self._imp_ is not None:\n        result = self._imp_(*[arg._evalf(**kwargs) for arg in self.args])\n        return result._evalf(**kwargs)\n    return self.func(*[arg._evalf(**kwargs) for arg in self.args])\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nERROR:\nNo replacement was performed, old_str `def _eval_evalf(self, **kwargs):` did not appear verbatim in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/core/function.py."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Parameter 'command)view</parameter' is not allowed for function 'str_replace_editor'.

The `evalf` method is supposed to evaluate expressions numerically, but when you have a composition of functions like `f(g(2))`, it doesn't evaluate and just returns the symbolic expression. This suggests that the `_eval_evalf` method in the `Function` class isn't handling the composition correctly.\n\nLooking at the repository structure, the SymPy code is in `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy`. The `Function` class is likely in `sympy/core/function.py`. I need to modify the `_eval_evalf` method to ensure it recursively calls `evalf` after using `_imp_`.\n\nI tried to create a test script to reproduce the issue, but there was an error in the function call. It seems the `str_replace_editor` function wasn't used correctly.

I'll also ensure that the `old_str` exactly matches the code in the file to avoid any issues with the replacement.\n\nAfter making the changes, I'll run the test script again to confirm that the issue is fixed. If it works, the composed functions should now evaluate correctly. If not, I'll need to check for any remaining issues or edge cases.\n\nOverall, the key steps are:\n1.
