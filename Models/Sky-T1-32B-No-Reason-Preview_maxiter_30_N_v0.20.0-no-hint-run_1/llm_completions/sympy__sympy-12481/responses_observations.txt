INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory sympy__sympy__1.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

################################################################################


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to fix the `Permutation` constructor in the SymPy repository so that it can handle non-disjoint cycles without raising a `ValueError`. The goal is to make `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` return the identity permutation instead of raising an error.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics, and it has a `Permutation` class that represents permutations, which are rearrangements of a set of objects.

In permutation group theory, a permutation can be represented in various ways, one of which is disjoint cycle notation. Disjoint cycles are cycles that don't share any elements. For example, `(0 1)(2 3)` are disjoint cycles because they act on different elements.

However, in the given PR description, there's an example of non-disjoint cycles: `[[0,1],[0,1]]`. Here, both cycles involve the element 0 and 1, so they are not disjoint.

The current behavior is that the `Permutation` constructor raises a `ValueError` when given non-disjoint cycles. The desired behavior is to allow non-disjoint cycles and compute the resulting permutation by applying the cycles from left to right.

So, my task is to modify the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.

### Step 1: Explore the Repository

First, I need to familiarize myself with the repository structure. The repository is located at `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0`. I should navigate to this directory and see what's inside.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0 &amp;&amp; ls
</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;&'
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 2]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems there was a syntax error in the command I tried to execute. The issue is with the use of `&` for running multiple commands in a single line. In bash, using `&` at the end of a command runs it in the background, but when used between commands, it needs to be separated properly.

Let me correct that and try again. I should use `&&` to run commands sequentially only if the previous command succeeds.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0 &amp;&amp; ls</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;&'
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 2]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems there is still a syntax error. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can run the commands separately.

First, I'll change the directory to `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0` and then list the contents.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:

[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Great, now I'm in the `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0` directory. Let's list the contents to see what's inside.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, this looks like a standard Python package structure. The `sympy` directory is likely the main package directory.

I need to find where the `Permutation` class is defined. Given that SymPy is a large library, it might be in a specific submodule.

Let me try to find the file that defines the `Permutation` class.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -r "class Permutation" sympy/</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:

sympy/physics/secondquant.py:class PermutationOperator(Expr):
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
There are multiple files that define a `Permutation` class. From the results:

1. `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py` has a `PermutationGroup` class.
2. `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` has a `Permutation` class.
3. `sympy/physics/secondquant.py` has a `PermutationOperator` class.

Given the context of the problem, which is about permutations in combinatorics, the relevant file is likely `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`.

I should look into that file to understand how the `Permutation` class is implemented.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
I've looked at the beginning of `permutations.py`, and it seems to be importing necessary modules and defining the `Permutation` class.

I need to find where the `Permutation` class is defined and how it handles the input cycles.

Let me search for the `class Permutation` definition.

<uploaded_files>
/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory sympy__sympy__1.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.

This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to fix the `Permutation` constructor in the SymPy repository so that it can handle non-disjoint cycles without raising a `ValueError`. The goal is to make `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` return the identity permutation instead of raising an error.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics, and it has a `Permutation` class that represents permutations, which are rearrangements of a set of objects.

In permutation group theory, a permutation can be represented in various ways, one of which is disjoint cycle notation. Disjoint cycles are cycles that don't share any elements. For example, `(0 1)(2 3)` are disjoint cycles because they act on different elements.

However, in the given PR description, there's an example of non-disjoint cycles: `[[0,1],[0,1]]`. Here, both cycles involve the element 0 and 1, so they are not disjoint.

The current behavior is that the `Permutation` constructor raises a `ValueError` when given non-disjoint cycles. The desired behavior is to allow non-disjoint cycles and compute the resulting permutation by applying the cycles from left to right.

So, my task is to modify the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.

### Step 1: Explore the Repository

First, I need to familiarize myself with the repository structure. The repository is located at `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0`. I should navigate to this directory and see what's inside.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0 &amp;&amp; ls
</parameter>

[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 2]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems there was a syntax error in the command I tried to execute. The issue is with the use of `&` for running multiple commands in a single line. In bash, using `&` at the end of a command runs it in the background, but when used between commands, it needs to be separated properly.

Let me correct that and try again. I should use `&&` to run commands sequentially only if the previous command succeeds.

<parameter=command>cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0 &amp;&amp; ls</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems there is still a syntax error. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can run the commands separately.

First, I'll change the directory to `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0` and then list the contents.

RESPONSE:
Okay, this looks like a standard Python package structure. The `sympy` directory is likely the main package directory.

I need to find where the `Permutation` class is defined. Given that SymPy is a large library, it might be in a specific submodule.

Let me try to find the file that defines the `Permutation` class.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -r "class Permutation" sympy/</parameter>

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
There are multiple files that define a `Permutation` class. From the results:

1. `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py` has a `PermutationGroup` class.
2. `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` has a `Permutation` class.
3. `sympy/physics/secondquant.py` has a `PermutationOperator` class.

Given the context of the problem, which is about permutations in combinatorics, the relevant file is likely `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`.

I should look into that file to understand how the `Permutation` class is implemented.

RESPONSE:
I'm reading through the `__new__` method documentation.

It seems that the constructor can accept permutations in two forms:

1. **Array form**: A list where the position of each element indicates its mapping. For example, `Permutation([0, 2, 1])` means that 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to 2, and 2 maps to 1.

2. **Cyclic form**: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a cycle. For example, `Permutation([[0, 1], [2, 3]])` represents the permutation that maps 0 to 1, 1 to 0, 2 to 3, and 3 to 2.

The constructor seems to handle both forms and converts cyclic form to array form.

I need to find where it handles cyclic form input and ensure that non-disjoint cycles are processed correctly.

Let me look for the part in the `__new__` method that handles cyclic form input.

RESPONSE:
I'm looking at lines 850-870 of `permutations.py`.

It seems that the constructor handles different types of input:

- No arguments: creates an identity permutation of size 0.
- Multiple arguments: treats them as a cycle.
- Single argument:
  - If it's another `Perm` object: returns a copy or adjusts the size.
  - If it's a `Cycle` object: converts it to array form.
  - Otherwise: assumes it's a list representing array form or cyclic form.

I need to find where it handles the cyclic form input, specifically when the single argument is a list of lists.

Let me look further down in the code.

Looking at lines 910-930, it seems that if the input is in cyclic form (`is_cycle` is True), it creates a `Cycle` object and converts it to array form.
