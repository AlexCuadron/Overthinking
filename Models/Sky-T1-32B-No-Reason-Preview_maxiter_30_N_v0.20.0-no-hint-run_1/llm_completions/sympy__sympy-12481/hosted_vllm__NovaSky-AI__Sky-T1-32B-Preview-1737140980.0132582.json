Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\n`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles\nCalling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, I've got this task to fix the `Permutation` constructor in the SymPy repository so that it can handle non-disjoint cycles without raising a `ValueError`. The goal is to make `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` return the identity permutation instead of raising an error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics, and it has a `Permutation` class that represents permutations, which are rearrangements of a set of objects.\n\nIn permutation group theory, a permutation can be represented in various ways, one of which is disjoint cycle notation. Disjoint cycles are cycles that don't share any elements. For example, `(0 1)(2 3)` are disjoint cycles because they act on different elements.\n\nHowever, in the given PR description, there's an example of non-disjoint cycles: `[[0,1],[0,1]]`. Here, both cycles involve the element 0 and 1, so they are not disjoint.\n\nThe current behavior is that the `Permutation` constructor raises a `ValueError` when given non-disjoint cycles. The desired behavior is to allow non-disjoint cycles and compute the resulting permutation by applying the cycles from left to right.\n\nSo, my task is to modify the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nFirst, I need to familiarize myself with the repository structure.

The issue is with the use of `&` for running multiple commands in a single line.

The goal is to make `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` return the identity permutation instead of raising an error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics, and it has a `Permutation` class that represents permutations, which are rearrangements of a set of objects.\n\nIn permutation group theory, a permutation can be represented in various ways, one of which is disjoint cycle notation. Disjoint cycles are cycles that don't share any elements. For example, `(0 1)(2 3)` are disjoint cycles because they act on different elements.\n\nHowever, in the given PR description, there's an example of non-disjoint cycles: `[[0,1],[0,1]]`. Here, both cycles involve the element 0 and 1, so they are not disjoint.\n\nThe current behavior is that the `Permutation` constructor raises a `ValueError` when given non-disjoint cycles. The desired behavior is to allow non-disjoint cycles and compute the resulting permutation by applying the cycles from left to right.\n\nSo, my task is to modify the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nFirst, I need to familiarize myself with the repository structure.
