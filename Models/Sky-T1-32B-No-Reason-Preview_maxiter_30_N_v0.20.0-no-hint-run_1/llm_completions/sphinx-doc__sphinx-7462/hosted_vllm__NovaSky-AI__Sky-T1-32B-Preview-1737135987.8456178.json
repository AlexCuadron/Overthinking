The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

The error occurs when using a specific type annotation for an empty tuple in Python. The user has provided a PR description that details the bug, how to reproduce it, and the expected behavior. My goal is to make the necessary changes to the non-test files in the repository to resolve this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The bug happens when using the type annotation `Tuple[()]` for a function that returns an empty tuple. When Sphinx tries to process this, it throws an IndexError because it's trying to pop from an empty list. This suggests there's an issue in how Sphinx handles this particular type annotation.\n\nI should start by exploring the repository to understand its structure. The repository is located in `/workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1`.

This suggests that somewhere in the code, there's an assumption that a list is not empty, which isn't always the case, especially with certain type annotations.\n\nI need to reproduce the error first to understand the context better. According to the PR description, the user has a function like this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef foo() -> Tuple[()]:\n    \"\"\"Sample text.\"\"\"\n    return ()\n```\n\nAnd when building the Sphinx documentation, it raises an `IndexError: pop from empty list`.\n\nTo reproduce this, I should create a sample Python file with this function, configure Sphinx to document it, and then build the documentation.\n\nFirst, I'll create a sample Python file, say `sample.py`, with the problematic function.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1/sample.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef foo() -> Tuple[()]:\n    \"\"\"Sample text.\"\"\"\n    return ()\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nFile created successfully at: /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.1/sample.py"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now that I have `sample.py`, I need to set up Sphinx to document this file.

Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n<extra_info>\nThe following information has been included based on a keyword match for \"github\". It may or may not be relevant to the user's request.\n\nYou have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with\nthe GitHub API.\n\nYou can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.\nALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.\n\nHere are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:\n* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch\n* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.\n* Prefer \"Draft\" pull requests when possible\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n    -d '{\"title\":\"Create widget\",\"head\":\"create-widget\",\"base\":\"openhands-workspace\"}'\n```\n</extra_info>", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Alright, I've got this task to fix an IndexError in a Sphinx documentation build. The error occurs when using a specific type annotation for an empty tuple in Python. The user has provided a PR description that details the bug, how to reproduce it, and the expected behavior. My goal is to make the necessary changes to the non-test files in the repository to resolve this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The bug happens when using the type annotation `Tuple[()]` for a function that returns an empty tuple. When Sphinx tries to process this, it throws an IndexError because it's trying to pop from an empty list. This suggests there's an issue in how Sphinx handles this particular type annotation.\n\nI should start by exploring the repository to understand its structure.

This suggests that somewhere in the code, there's an assumption that a list is not empty, which isn't always the case, especially with certain type annotations.\n\nI need to reproduce the error first to understand the context better.
