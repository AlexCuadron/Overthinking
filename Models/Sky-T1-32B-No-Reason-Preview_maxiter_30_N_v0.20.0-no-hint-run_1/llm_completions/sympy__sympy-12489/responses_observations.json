  "initial_issue": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\ncombinatorics.Permutation can't be subclassed properly\nI stumbled across a subclassing issue with `combinatorics.Permutation`:\r\nThe object creation is done in `Permutation.__new__`, but internally the function `_af_new` is used (which itself is a reference to the static method `Permutation._af_new`). This method eventually creates the object calling `Basic.__new__(Perm, perm)` (`Perm` is a reference to `Permutation`).\r\nIn the end, this makes subclassing `Permutation` impossible (besides overriding `Permutation._af_new` as always instances of `Permutation` are returned.\r\n\r\nAn elegant solution would be to stick to Python's instance creation mechanisms, i.e. use classmethods where appropriate (`__new__` is one) and use the mandatory reference to the class (the first argument of a classmethod) the method is called on for instance creation.\r\n\r\nI'm completely new to sympy development and encountered this issue whilst trying to subclass `Permutation`. Therefore I'm not aware of any side effects changing the instance creation probably has. (I monkeypatched it locally and ran the tests, all succeeded.)\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a coherent explanation why the implementation is as it is and should not be changed?\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n",

Let me start by understanding what the problem is.\n\nFrom the PR description, it seems that when trying to subclass `Permutation`, something goes wrong because of how instances are created. The creation is handled in `__new__`, but it uses an internal function `_af_new`, which always returns instances of `Permutation` instead of the subclass. This makes it impossible to properly subclass `Permutation`.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the `Permutation` class in the repository. The repository is in `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0`.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\ncombinatorics.Permutation can't be subclassed properly\nI stumbled across a subclassing issue with `combinatorics.Permutation`:\r\nThe object creation is done in `Permutation.__new__`, but internally the function `_af_new` is used (which itself is a reference to the static method `Permutation._af_new`). This method eventually creates the object calling `Basic.__new__(Perm, perm)` (`Perm` is a reference to `Permutation`).\r\nIn the end, this makes subclassing `Permutation` impossible (besides overriding `Permutation._af_new` as always instances of `Permutation` are returned.\r\n\r\nAn elegant solution would be to stick to Python's instance creation mechanisms, i.e. use classmethods where appropriate (`__new__` is one) and use the mandatory reference to the class (the first argument of a classmethod) the method is called on for instance creation.\r\n\r\nI'm completely new to sympy development and encountered this issue whilst trying to subclass `Permutation`. Therefore I'm not aware of any side effects changing the instance creation probably has. (I monkeypatched it locally and ran the tests, all succeeded.)\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a coherent explanation why the implementation is as it is and should not be changed?\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"

      "response": "Alright, I've got this task to fix the subclassing issue in the SymPy repository, specifically in the `combinatorics.Permutation` class. Let me start by understanding what the problem is.\n\nFrom the PR description, it seems that when trying to subclass `Permutation`, something goes wrong because of how instances are created. The creation is handled in `__new__`, but it uses an internal function `_af_new`, which always returns instances of `Permutation` instead of the subclass. This makes it impossible to properly subclass `Permutation`.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the `Permutation` class in the repository. The repository is in `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0`.

It's a static method that creates a new `Permutation` instance from a list.\n\nThe PR description mentions that this method always returns instances of `Permutation`, which prevents subclassing.\n\nIn Python, when subclassing, it's important that the `__new__` method of the subclass is called to create instances of the subclass, not the base class.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the creation of instances so that when a subclass is used, its `__new__` method is called instead of always creating `Permutation` instances.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to use the class passed to `__new__` (i.e., `cls`) to create the instance, rather than hardcoding `Permutation`.\n\nLet me think about how to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that when `__new__` is called on a subclass, it uses the subclass's `__new__` method.\n\nBut in the current implementation, `_af_new` is a static method that always creates `Permutation` instances.\n\nI need to change `_af_new` to accept the class (`cls`) as an argument and use `cls` to create the instance, so that if `cls` is a subclass, its `__new__` method is used.\n\nLet me look at how `_af_new` is used in the code.\n\nFrom the earlier grep results, `_af_new` is used in many places throughout the file.\n\nI need to make sure that all these uses are updated appropriately.\n\nBut before making widespread changes, I should confirm that changing `_af_new` to accept `cls` as an argument and using `cls` instead of `Permutation` will solve the subclassing issue.\n\nLet me try to modify `_af_new` to accept `cls` and use it for instance creation.\n\nI'll need to pass `cls` to `_af_new` from `__new__`.\n\nBut since `_af_new` is a static method, it doesn't receive `cls` automatically.\n\nI need to adjust the signature of `_af_new` to accept `cls` as the first argument.\n\nWait, but static methods don't take `cls` as the first argument; they don't have any implicit first argument.\n\nMaybe I should make `_af_new` a class method, so it receives `cls` as the first argument.\n\nAlternatively, I can keep it as a static method and pass `cls` explicitly when calling it.\n\nI think passing `cls` explicitly is better, as it makes the code clearer.\n\nLet me try to modify `_af_new` to accept `cls` as the first argument.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>\n   927\t    @staticmethod\n   928\t    def _af_new(perm):\n   929\t        \"\"\"A method to produce a Permutation object from a list;\n   930\t        the list is bound to the _array_form attribute, so it must\n   931\t        not be modified; this method is meant for internal use only;\n   932\t        the list ``a`` is supposed to be generated as a temporary value\n   933\t        in a method, so p = Perm._af_new(a) is the only object\n   934\t        to hold a reference to ``a``::\n   935\t\n   936\t        Examples\n   937\t        ========\n   938\t\n   939\t        >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Perm\n   940\t        >>> Perm.print_cyclic = False\n   941\t\n   942\t        >>> a = [0, 1, 2]\n   943\t        >>> p = Perm._af_new(a)\n   944\t        >>> p.array_form\n   945\t        [0, 1, 2]\n   946\t\n   947\t        >>> isinstance(p, Perm)\n   948\t        True\n   949\t\n   950\t        \"\"\"\n   951\t        aform = _af_check(perm)\n   952\t        size = len(aform)\n   953\t        obj = Basic.__new__(Perm, aform)\n   954\t        obj._array_form = aform\n   955\t        obj._size = size\n   956\t        return obj\n</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>\n   927\t    @staticmethod\n   928\t    def _af_new(cls, perm):\n   929\t        \"\"\"A method to produce a Permutation object from a list;\n   930\t        the list is bound to the _array_form attribute, so it must\n   931\t        not be modified; this method is meant for internal use only;\n   932\t        the list ``a`` is supposed to be generated as a temporary value\n   933\t        in a method, so p = Perm._af_new(a) is the only object\n   934\t        to hold a reference to ``a``::\n   935\t\n   936\t        Examples\n   937\t        ========\n   938\t\n   939\t        >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Perm\n   940\t        >>> Perm.print_cyclic = False\n   941\t\n   942\t        >>> a = [0, 1, 2]\n   943\t        >>> p = Perm._af_new(Perm, a)\n   944\t        >>> p.array_form\n   945\t        [0, 1, 2]\n   946\t\n   947\t        >>> isinstance(p, Perm)\n   948\t        True\n   949\t\n   950\t        \"\"\"\n   951\t        aform = _af_check(perm)\n   952\t        size = len(aform)\n   953\t        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, aform)\n   954\t        obj._array_form = aform\n   955\t        obj._size = size\n   956\t        return obj\n</parameter>\n",

      "response": "I see, the actual code in the file is slightly different from what I had in mind.\n\nSpecifically, the `__new__` method is defined earlier, and `_af_new` is a static method that creates a `Permutation` instance using `Basic.__new__(Perm, perm)`.\n\nI need to adjust my approach.\n\nInstead of trying to modify `_af_new` directly, perhaps I should make `_af_new` a class method so that it can access and use `cls`.\n\nAlternatively, I can pass `cls` as an argument to `_af_new`.\n\nBut since `_af_new` is used in many places, I need to ensure that `cls` is passed correctly everywhere.\n\nThis might be tricky, as some calls to `_af_new` are from static methods or places where `cls` is not readily available.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to make `_af_new` a class method, so it can access `cls` and use it for instance creation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, I need to change the definition of `_af_new` to a classmethod:\n\n```python\n@classmethod\ndef _af_new(cls, perm):\n    aform = _af_check(perm)\n    size = len(aform)\n    obj = Basic.__new__(cls, aform)\n    obj._array_form = aform\n    obj._size = size\n    return obj\n```\n\nThen, wherever `_af_new` is called, I need to make sure that it's called on the class, like `Permutation._af_new(perm)`, or on the subclass if it's a subclass.\n\nBut in many places, `_af_new` is called as a static method without `cls`, like `Perm._af_new(a)`. I need to adjust these calls to include `cls`.\n\nThis might require finding all places where `_af_new` is called and changing them to use the class method syntax.\n\nThis could be error-prone and time-consuming, especially since `_af_new` is used in many places.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider making `_af_new` a class method that can be overridden by subclasses if needed.\n\nBut in this case, since the issue is that subclasses aren't being respected in instance creation, making `_af_new` a class method that uses `cls` should suffice.\n\nI need to ensure that all calls to `_af_new` are made with the correct `cls` argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can modify the `__new__` method to set the class appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make `_af_new` accept `cls` as an argument and set it to `Permutation` by default, like this:\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef _af_new(perm, cls=Permutation):\n    aform = _af_check(perm)\n    size = len(aform)\n    obj = Basic.__new__(cls, aform)\n    obj._array_form = aform\n    obj._size = size\n    return obj\n```\n\nThen, in subclasses, when calling `_af_new`, they can pass `cls` explicitly.\n\nBut this might not work in all cases, especially if `cls` is not passed.\n\nI need a more robust solution.\n\nLet me consider making `_af_new` a class method, so it always has access to `cls`.\n\nThen, in places where `_af_new` is called, I need to call it on the class, like `cls._af_new(perm)`.\n\nBut this requires changing all calls to `_af_new` to include `cls`.\n\nGiven the number of places where `_af_new` is used, this might be too invasive.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to modify the `__new__` method to handle subclassing correctly.\n\nLet me look at the `__new__` method again.\n\nFrom line 801:\n\n```python\ndef __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n    ...\n    if isinstance(a, (int, Integer)):\n        size = int(a)\n        if size < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Size must be a nonnegative integer\")\n        return _af_new(list(range(size or 0)))\n    elif isinstance(a, Cycle):\n        return _af_new(Cycle(*args).list(size))\n    elif isinstance(a, Permutation):\n        return _af_new(a.list(size))\n    elif isinstance(a, (list, tuple)):\n        return _af_new(list(a))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid permutation argument\")\n```\n\nHere, `_af_new` is called directly, without passing `cls`.\n\nI need to change these calls to use `cls` for instance creation.\n\nPerhaps I can replace `_af_new` with `cls._af_new` in these calls.\n\nBut first, I need to ensure that `_af_new` is a class method that accepts `cls`.\n\nLet me try to redefine `_af_new` as a class method.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>\n927     @staticmethod\n   928     def _af_new(perm):\n   929         \"\"\"A method to produce a Permutation object from a list;\n   930         the list is bound to the _array_form attribute, so it must\n   931         not be modified;

  "final_response": "I see, the actual code in the file is slightly different from what I had in mind.\n\nSpecifically, the `__new__` method is defined earlier, and `_af_new` is a static method that creates a `Permutation` instance using `Basic.__new__(Perm, perm)`.\n\nI need to adjust my approach.\n\nInstead of trying to modify `_af_new` directly, perhaps I should make `_af_new` a class method so that it can access and use `cls`.\n\nAlternatively, I can pass `cls` as an argument to `_af_new`.\n\nBut since `_af_new` is used in many places, I need to ensure that `cls` is passed correctly everywhere.\n\nThis might be tricky, as some calls to `_af_new` are from static methods or places where `cls` is not readily available.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to make `_af_new` a class method, so it can access `cls` and use it for instance creation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, I need to change the definition of `_af_new` to a classmethod:\n\n```python\n@classmethod\ndef _af_new(cls, perm):\n    aform = _af_check(perm)\n    size = len(aform)\n    obj = Basic.__new__(cls, aform)\n    obj._array_form = aform\n    obj._size = size\n    return obj\n```\n\nThen, wherever `_af_new` is called, I need to make sure that it's called on the class, like `Permutation._af_new(perm)`, or on the subclass if it's a subclass.\n\nBut in many places, `_af_new` is called as a static method without `cls`, like `Perm._af_new(a)`. I need to adjust these calls to include `cls`.\n\nThis could be error-prone and time-consuming, especially since `_af_new` is used in many places.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet me consider making `_af_new` a class method that can be overridden by subclasses if needed.\n\nBut in this case, since the issue is that subclasses aren't being respected in instance creation, making `_af_new` a class method that uses `cls` should suffice.\n\nI need to ensure that all calls to `_af_new` are made with the correct `cls` argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make `_af_new` accept `cls` as an argument with a default value of `Permutation`.\n\nThen, in subclasses, when calling `_af_new`, they can pass `cls` explicitly.\n\nBut this might not work in all cases, especially if `cls` is not passed.\n\nI need a more robust solution.\n\nLet me consider modifying the `__new__` method to handle subclassing correctly.\n\nLet me look at the `__new__` method again.\n\nFrom line 801:\n\n```python\ndef __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n    ...\n    if isinstance(a, (int, Integer)):\n        size = int(a)\n        if size < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Size must be a nonnegative integer\")\n        return _af_new(list(range(size or 0)))\n    elif isinstance(a, Cycle):\n        return _af_new(Cycle(*args).list(size))\n    elif isinstance(a, Permutation):\n        return _af_new(a.list(size))\n    elif isinstance(a, (list, tuple)):\n        return _af_new(list(a))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid permutation argument\")\n```\n\nHere, `_af_new` is called directly, without passing `cls`.\n\nI need to change these calls to use `cls` for instance creation.\n\nPerhaps I can replace `_af_new` with `cls._af_new` in these calls.\n\nBut first, I need to ensure that `_af_new` is a class method that accepts `cls`.\n\nLet me try to redefine `_af_new` as a class method.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>\n927     @staticmethod\n   928     def _af_new(perm):\n   929         \"\"\"A method to produce a Permutation object from a list;\n   930         the list is bound to the _array_form attribute, so it must\n   931         not be modified; this method is meant for internal use only;\n   932         the list ``a`` is supposed to be generated as a temporary value\n   933         in a method, so p = Perm._af_new(a) is the only object\n   934         to hold a reference to ``a``::\n   935\n   936         Examples\n   937         ========\n   938\n   939         >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Perm\n   940         >>> Perm.print_cyclic = False\n   941\n   942         >>> a = [0, 1, 2]\n   943         >>> p = Perm._af_new(a)\n   944         >>> p.array_form\n   945         [0, 1, 2]\n   946\n   947         >>> isinstance(p, Perm)\n   948         True\n   949\n   950         \"\"\"\n   951         aform = _af_check(perm)\n   952         size = len(aform)\n   953         obj = Basic.__new__(Perm, aform)\n   954         obj._array_form = aform\n   955         obj._size = size\n   956         return obj\n</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>\n927     @classmethod\n   928     def _af_new(cls, perm):\n   929         \"\"\"A method to produce a Permutation object from a list;\n   930         the list is bound to the _array_form attribute, so it must\n   931         not be modified; this method is meant for internal use only;\n   932         the list ``a`` is supposed to be generated as a temporary value\n   933         in a method, so p = Perm._af_new(a) is the only object\n   934         to hold a reference to ``a``::\n   935\n   936         Examples\n   937         ========\n   938\n   939         >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Perm\n   940         >>> Perm.print_cyclic = False\n   941\n   942         >>> a = [0, 1, 2]\n   943         >>> p = Perm._af_new(Perm, a)\n   944         >>> p.array_form\n   945         [0, 1, 2]\n   946\n   947         >>> isinstance(p, Perm)\n   948         True\n   949\n   950         \"\"\"\n   951         aform = _af_check(perm)\n   952         size = len(aform)\n   953         obj = Basic.__new__(cls, aform)\n   954         obj._array_form = aform\n   955         obj._size = size\n   956         return obj\n</parameter>\n",
