Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\npartitions() reusing the output dictionaries\nThe partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, I've got this task to work on. Let's see what needs to be done. So, there's this Python code repository in the directory `sympy__sympy__1.7`, and there's a PR description that talks about the `partitions()` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`. The issue is that this function reuses the output dictionaries, which can lead to confusing results and potential bugs, especially when someone tries to use the partitions in a non-trivial way.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what `partitions()` does. From what I recall, in sympy, `partitions()` is likely a function that generates all possible partitions of a given set or number. Since it's in `sympy.utilities.iterables`, it's probably a utility function for generating partitions in an efficient manner.\n\nThe problem seems to be that it reuses the same dictionary object for each partition it yields, which means that if you try to collect all partitions into a list, for example, you'll end up with a list of references to the same dictionary, which has been updated to the last partition. That would indeed be confusing and could lead to bugs.\n\nSo, the task is to modify `partitions()` so that it doesn't reuse the output dictionaries, meaning each yielded partition should be a separate dictionary object.\n\nAlright, let's start by exploring the repository to understand its structure. I need to find where `partitions()` is defined.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.7 && find . -name '*iterables*.py'</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n./sympy/utilities/tests/test_iterables.py\n./sympy/utilities/iterables.py\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so there's `iterables.py` in `sympy/utilities/` and a corresponding test file in `sympy/utilities/tests/`.

It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing.

Let's see what needs to be done. So, there's this Python code repository in the directory `sympy__sympy__1.7`, and there's a PR description that talks about the `partitions()` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`. The issue is that this function reuses the output dictionaries, which can lead to confusing results and potential bugs, especially when someone tries to use the partitions in a non-trivial way.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what `partitions()` does. From what I recall, in sympy, `partitions()` is likely a function that generates all possible partitions of a given set or number. Since it's in `sympy.utilities.iterables`, it's probably a utility function for generating partitions in an efficient manner.\n\nThe problem seems to be that it reuses the same dictionary object for each partition it yields, which means that if you try to collect all partitions into a list, for example, you'll end up with a list of references to the same dictionary, which has been updated to the last partition. That would indeed be confusing and could lead to bugs.\n\nSo, the task is to modify `partitions()` so that it doesn't reuse the output dictionaries, meaning each yielded partition should be a separate dictionary object.\n\nAlright, let's start by exploring the repository to understand its structure.
