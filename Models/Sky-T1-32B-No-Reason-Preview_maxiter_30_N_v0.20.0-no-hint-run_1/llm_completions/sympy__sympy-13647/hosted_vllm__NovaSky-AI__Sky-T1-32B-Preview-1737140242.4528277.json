Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue with SymPy's Matrix.col_insert() method. The problem is that when you insert columns into a matrix, the existing columns get shifted in a way that's not expected. I need to make sure that the insertion works correctly without altering the positions of the original columns in an unexpected way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. Since it's version 1.1.1, I should look into the Matrix module and find where col_insert() is defined. Probably in the sympy/matrices folder.\n\nI should start by writing a script that reproduces the error, as described in the PR description. That way, I can verify that the issue exists and then test my fix.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Explore the repository to find the Matrix class and the col_insert() method.\n\n2. Write a Python script that creates a 6x6 identity matrix, creates a 6x2 matrix of twos, and then inserts the columns of twos at column index 3 of the identity matrix.\n\n3. Check the output to see if it matches the incorrect example given.\n\n4. Debug the col_insert() method to understand why the insertion is causing the shift.\n\n5. Modify the col_insert() method to fix the issue.\n\n6. Rerun the script to confirm the fix.\n\n7. Consider edge cases, like inserting columns at the beginning, end, or beyond the current number of columns.\n\nLet me start by writing the script to reproduce the error.\n\nI'll create a file called test_col_insert.py with the following content:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sm\n\nM = sm.eye(6)\nV = 2 * sm.ones(6, 2)\nresult = M.col_insert(3, V)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThen, I'll run this script using Python to see the output.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that I'm using SymPy version 1.1.1, as specified in the PR description.\n\nLet me check the SymPy version first.\n\nI can add `print(sm.__version__)` to the script to confirm.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the environment has SymPy installed.\n\nBut since this is a repository, perhaps SymPy is already installed, or I might need to install it.\n\nWait, the repository is SymPy itself, so it should have all the necessary files.\n\nMaybe I don't need to install anything; I can run the script within the repository.\n\nLet me try to write the script and execute it.\n\nFirst, I need to navigate to the repository directory.\n\nI think the repository is in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1.\n\nI should change to that directory.\n\nThen, create the test script.\n\nWait, but in the repository, there might be a specific way to run scripts.\n\nPerhaps I should look for an examples or tests directory to see how scripts are usually run.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a development environment, I can just create a script in the root directory.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nI'll create a file called test_col_insert.py in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1.\n\nHere's the content:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sm\n\nM = sm.eye(6)\nV = 2 * sm.ones(6, 2)\nresult = M.col_insert(3, V)\nprint(result)\nprint(sm.__version__)\n```\n\nNow, I need to run this script using Python.\n\nI'll use the execute_bash function to run `python test_col_insert.py`.\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that Python can find the SymPy module.\n\nSince I'm in the repository directory, it should be able to import SymPy.\n\nLet me try running the script.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>cd /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1 && python test_col_insert.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\npython: can't open file '/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/test_col_insert.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 2]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like the script file `test_col_insert.py` doesn't exist in the specified directory.

Columns 0,1,2 from M\n\n  - Columns 3,4 from V\n\n  - Columns 5,6,7 from M (original columns 3,4,5)\n\nBut in the actual output, columns 5,6,7 are coming from original columns 0,1,2, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nIn the actual output:\n\n```\n\u23a11  0  0  2  2  1  0  0\u23a4\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  1  0  2  2  0  1  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  1  2  2  0  0  1\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a30  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a6\n```\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- Columns 0,1,2: 1,0,0 (correct from M)\n\n- Columns 3,4: 2,2 (from V)\n\n- Columns 5,6,7: 1,0,0 (which should be original columns 3,4,5 of M, but in M, row 0 columns 3,4,5 are 0,0,0)\n\nSo, it's taking the first three columns of M and placing them at columns 5,6,7, which is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that in the `entry` function, when `j >= pos + other.cols`, it should be taking elements from `self` starting from column `j - pos - other.cols`.\n\nBut in the current implementation, it's doing exactly that.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the way the matrix is being indexed.\n\nPerhaps the issue is with how the matrix is being flattened or how the entries are being mapped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an off-by-one error in the indexing.\n\nLet me try to implement a simple example manually to see where the mistake is.\n\nConsider a 2x2 identity matrix:\n\n```\nM = [[1, 0],\n     [0, 1]]\n```\n\nInsert a column vector V = [[2], [2]] at position 1:\n\n```\nM.col_insert(1, V) should give:\n\n[[1, 2, 0],\n [0, 2, 1]]\n```\n\nAccording to the current implementation:\n\n- For j < 1: take from M\n\n- For 1 <= j < 1 + 1: take from V\n\n- For j >= 1 + 1: take from M, shifted left by 1 column\n\nSo, for j=0: take M[i,0]\n\nj=1: take V[i,1-1]=V[i,0]\n\nj=2: take M[i,2-1-1]=M[i,0]\n\nWait, that can't be right. For j=2, it should be taking M[i,1], but according to the formula, it's taking M[i,0].\n\nThis suggests that there's an off-by-one error in the indexing.\n\nThe correct formula should be:\n\nFor j >= pos + other.cols:\n\nreturn self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n\nBut in the above example, for j=2, pos=1, other.cols=1:\n\nj - pos - other.cols = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo, it takes M[i,0], but it should be taking M[i,1].\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nreturn self[i, j -

From the PR description and the example provided, it seems like there's an issue with how columns are being shifted during the insertion process.\n\nI've looked into the `col_insert` method in the `common.py` file, and it appears that the logic for inserting columns and shifting the existing columns is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way the new matrix is being constructed seems to be causing the original columns to be shifted in an unexpected manner.\n\nTo fix this, I need to adjust the logic in the `col_insert` method so that the original columns remain in their correct positions relative to the inserted columns.\n\nLet me try to outline the correct steps for inserting columns:\n\n1. **Identify the position (`pos`) where the new columns should be inserted.**\n2. **Take the original matrix (`self`) and the matrix (`other`) whose columns are to be inserted.**\n3. **Create a new matrix with the same number of rows as the original matrix but with the number of columns increased by the number of columns in `other`.**\n4. **In the new matrix:**\n   - For columns before `pos`, copy the corresponding columns from the original matrix.\n   - For columns from `pos` to `pos + other.cols - 1`, copy the columns from `other`.\n   - For columns from `pos + other.cols` onwards, copy the remaining columns from the original matrix.\n\nThe issue in the current implementation seems to be with how the columns are being mapped in the new matrix, particularly in the part where it shifts the original columns after the inserted columns.\n\nLet's look at the current implementation again:\n\n```python\ndef col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    cols = self.cols\n\n    def entry(i, j):\n        if j < pos:\n            return self[i, j]\n        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\n            return other[i, j - pos]\n        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n\n    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,\n                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))\n```\n\nFrom the example provided, when inserting two columns from `V` into `M` at position 3, the original columns of `M` are being shifted incorrectly.\n\nI think the problem lies in the way the original columns are being shifted. Specifically, this part:\n\n```python\nreturn self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n```\n\nMight need to be adjusted.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe instead of trying to compute the shifted indices on the fly, I can construct the new matrix by concatenating slices of the original matrix and the other matrix.\n\nSymPy's matrices have methods like `col_slice` that can be used to extract columns between certain positions. Maybe I can use these methods to build the new matrix in a more straightforward way.\n\nHere's an alternative approach:\n\n1. **Extract the columns from the original matrix before the insertion position (`pos`).**\n2. **Extract the columns from the `other` matrix to be inserted.**\n3. **Extract the columns from the original matrix starting from the insertion position (`pos`).**\n4. **Concatenate these three parts horizontally to form the new matrix.**\n\nThis seems more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the original matrix's columns before `pos` are unchanged.\n\nThen, insert the columns from `other`.\n\nFinally, append the remaining columns from the original matrix starting from `pos`.\n\nIn code, this would look like:\n\n```python\ndef col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    # Extract columns before pos\n    part1 = self[:, :pos]\n    # Extract columns to be inserted\n    part2 = other\n    # Extract columns from pos onwards\n    part3 = self[:, pos:]\n    # Concatenate them horizontally\n    return part1.row_join(part2).row_join(part3)\n```\n\nWait, but in SymPy, `row_join` is used to concatenate matrices horizontally.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nGiven that `row_join` concatenates matrices horizontally, this should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example provided.\n\nGiven:\n\n```python\nM = sm.eye(6)\nV = 2 * sm.ones(6, 2)\nresult = M.col_insert(3, V)\n```\n\nAccording to this new implementation:\n\n- `part1 = M[:, :3]` which is the first three columns of the identity matrix.\n\n- `part2 = V`, which is the matrix of twos with 6 rows and 2 columns.\n\n- `part3 = M[:, 3:]` which is the last three columns of the identity matrix.\n\nThen, `result = part1.row_join(part2).row_join(part3)`\n\nThis should give:\n\n```\n\u23a11  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a4\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  1  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  1  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  1  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  1  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a30  0  0  2  2  0  0  1\u23a6\n```\n\nWhich matches the expected output.\n\nIn contrast, the current implementation gives:\n\n```\n\u23a11  0  0  2  2  1  0  0\u23a4\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  1  0  2  2  0  1  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  1  2  2  0  0  1\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a30  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a6\n```\n\nWhich is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, replacing the `col_insert` method with the new implementation should fix the issue.\n\nLet me proceed to edit the `common.py` file to implement this change.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/matrices/common.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>\ndef col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    cols = self.cols\n\n    def entry(i, j):\n        if j < pos:\n            return self[i, j]\n        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\n            return other[i, j - pos]\n        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n\n    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,\n                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))\n</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>\ndef col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    part1 = self[:, :pos]\n    part2 = other\n    part3 = self[:, pos:]\n    return part1.row_join(part2).row_join(part3)\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nERROR:\nNo replacement was performed, old_str `def col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    cols = self.cols\n\n    def entry(i, j):\n        if j < pos:\n            return self[i, j]\n        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\n            return other[i, j - pos]\n        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n\n    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,\n                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))` did not appear verbatim in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/matrices/common.py."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-5995bc726ae6427d9748f74a7636fccf", "created": 1737140163, "model": "hosted_vllm/NovaSky-AI/Sky-T1-32B-Preview", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "It seems like the `old_str` I provided didn't match the actual content in `common.py`, possibly due to formatting or indentation differences.

From the PR description and the example provided, it seems like there's an issue with how columns are being shifted during the insertion process.\n\nI've looked into the `col_insert` method in the `common.py` file, and it appears that the logic for inserting columns and shifting the existing columns is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way the new matrix is being constructed seems to be causing the original columns to be shifted in an unexpected manner.\n\nTo fix this, I need to adjust the logic in the `col_insert` method so that the original columns remain in their correct positions relative to the inserted columns.\n\nLet me try to outline the correct steps for inserting columns:\n\n1. **Identify the position (`pos`) where the new columns should be inserted.**\n2. **Take the original matrix (`self`) and the matrix (`other`) whose columns are to be inserted.**\n3. **Create a new matrix with the same number of rows as the original matrix but with the number of columns increased by the number of columns in `other`.**\n4. **In the new matrix:**\n   - For columns before `pos`, copy the corresponding columns from the original matrix.\n   - For columns from `pos` to `pos + other.cols - 1`, copy the columns from `other`.\n   - For columns from `pos + other.cols` onwards, copy the remaining columns from the original matrix.\n\nThe issue in the current implementation seems to be with how the columns are being mapped in the new matrix, particularly in the part where it shifts the original columns after the inserted columns.\n\nLet's look at the current implementation again:\n\n```python\ndef col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    cols = self.cols\n\n    def entry(i, j):\n        if j < pos:\n            return self[i, j]\n        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\n            return other[i, j - pos]\n        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n\n    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,\n                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))\n```\n\nFrom the example provided, when inserting two columns from `V` into `M` at position 3, the original columns of `M` are being shifted incorrectly.\n\nI think the problem lies in the way the original columns are being shifted. Specifically, this part:\n\n```python\nreturn self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n```\n\nMight need to be adjusted.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe instead of trying to compute the shifted indices on the fly, I can construct the new matrix by concatenating slices of the original matrix and the other matrix.\n\nSymPy's matrices have methods like `col_slice` that can be used to extract columns between certain positions. Maybe I can use these methods to build the new matrix in a more straightforward way.\n\nHere's an alternative approach:\n\n1. **Extract the columns from the original matrix before the insertion position (`pos`).**\n2. **Extract the columns from the `other` matrix to be inserted.**\n3. **Extract the columns from the original matrix starting from the insertion position (`pos`).**\n4. **Concatenate these three parts horizontally to form the new matrix.**\n\nThis seems more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the original matrix's columns before `pos` are unchanged.\n\nThen, insert the columns from `other`.\n\nFinally, append the remaining columns from the original matrix starting from `pos`.\n\nIn code, this would look like:\n\n```python\ndef col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    # Extract columns before pos\n    part1 = self[:, :pos]\n    # Extract columns to be inserted\n    part2 = other\n    # Extract columns from pos onwards\n    part3 = self[:, pos:]\n    # Concatenate them horizontally\n    return part1.row_join(part2).row_join(part3)\n```\n\nWait, but in SymPy, `row_join` is used to concatenate matrices horizontally.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nGiven that `row_join` concatenates matrices horizontally, this should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example provided.\n\nGiven:\n\n```python\nM = sm.eye(6)\nV = 2 * sm.ones(6, 2)\nresult = M.col_insert(3, V)\n```\n\nAccording to this new implementation:\n\n- `part1 = M[:, :3]` which is the first three columns of the identity matrix.\n\n- `part2 = V`, which is the matrix of twos with 6 rows and 2 columns.\n\n- `part3 = M[:, 3:]` which is the last three columns of the identity matrix.\n\nThen, `result = part1.row_join(part2).row_join(part3)`\n\nThis should give:\n\n```\n\u23a11  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a4\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  1  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  1  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  1  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  1  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a30  0  0  2  2  0  0  1\u23a6\n```\n\nWhich matches the expected output.\n\nIn contrast, the current implementation gives:\n\n```\n\u23a11  0  0  2  2  1  0  0\u23a4\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  1  0  2  2  0  1  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  1  2  2  0  0  1\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a20  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a5\n\u23a2                      \u23a5\n\u23a30  0  0  2  2  0  0  0\u23a6\n```\n\nWhich is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, replacing the `col_insert` method with the new implementation should fix the issue.\n\nLet me proceed to edit the `common.py` file to implement this change.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_09", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/matrices/common.py\", \"old_str\": \"def col_insert(self, pos, other):\\n    cols = self.cols\\n\\n    def entry(i, j):\\n        if j < pos:\\n            return self[i, j]\\n        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\\n            return other[i, j - pos]\\n        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\\n\\n    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,\\n                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))\", \"new_str\": \"def col_insert(self, pos, other):\\n    part1 = self[:, :pos]\\n    part2 = other\\n    part3 = self[:, pos:]\\n    return part1.row_join(part2).row_join(part3)\"}"}}]}, {"content": "ERROR:\nNo replacement was performed, old_str `def col_insert(self, pos, other):\n    cols = self.cols\n\n    def entry(i, j):\n        if j < pos:\n            return self[i, j]\n        elif pos <= j < pos + other.cols:\n            return other[i, j - pos]\n        return self[i, j - pos - other.cols]\n\n    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,\n                     lambda i, j: entry(i, j))` did not appear verbatim in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/matrices/common.py.", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_09", "name": "str_replace_editor"}], "fncall_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-5995bc726ae6427d9748f74a7636fccf", "created": 1737140163, "model": "hosted_vllm/NovaSky-AI/Sky-T1-32B-Preview", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "It seems like the `old_str` I provided didn't match the actual content in `common.py`, possibly due to formatting or indentation differences.
