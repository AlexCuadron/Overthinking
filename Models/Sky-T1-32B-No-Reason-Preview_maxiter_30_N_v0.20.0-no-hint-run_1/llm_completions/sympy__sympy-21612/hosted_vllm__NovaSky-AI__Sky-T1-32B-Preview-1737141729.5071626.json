The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added).

If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

The LaTeX expression `\"\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}\"` is being parsed incorrectly. Let's see what it's supposed to do and what it's actually doing.\n\nAccording to the description, the current parsing results in `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)`, but the expected output is `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`. The difference is in how the denominators are handled\u2014specifically, the missing brackets.\n\nI need to locate the part of the code that handles LaTeX fraction parsing.

ANTLR is a parser generator that creates parsers based on grammar files, and in this case, `LaTeX.g4` defines the grammar for LaTeX math expressions.\n\nThe issue seems to be with how fractions are parsed, specifically nested fractions. The parser is not adding the necessary brackets in the denominator, leading to incorrect expression parsing.\n\nI need to open the `LaTeX.g4` file and look for the rules related to fractions. In LaTeX, fractions are denoted by `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}`, so there should be a rule in the grammar that matches this pattern.\n\nLet me open `LaTeX.g4` and search for `FRACTION`.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.9/sympy/parsing/latex/LaTeX.g4</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[1, 10]</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.9/sympy/parsing/latex/LaTeX.g4:\n     1\t/*\n     2\t ANTLR4 LaTeX Math Grammar\n     3\t\n     4\t Ported from latex2sympy by @augustt198 https://github.com/augustt198/latex2sympy See license in\n     5\t LICENSE.txt\n     6\t */\n     7\t\n     8\t/*\n     9\t After changing this file, it is necessary to run `python setup.py antlr` in the root directory of\n    10\t the repository.

The difference is in how the denominators are handled\u2014specifically, the missing brackets.\n\nI need to locate the part of the code that handles LaTeX fraction parsing. SymPy's LaTeX parser is likely part of the `parsing` module, probably in `sympy.parsing.latex`.

ANTLR is a parser generator that creates parsers based on grammar files, and in this case, `LaTeX.g4` defines the grammar for LaTeX math expressions.\n\nThe issue seems to be with how fractions are parsed, specifically nested fractions. The parser is not adding the necessary brackets in the denominator, leading to incorrect expression parsing.\n\nI need to open the `LaTeX.g4` file and look for the rules related to fractions.
