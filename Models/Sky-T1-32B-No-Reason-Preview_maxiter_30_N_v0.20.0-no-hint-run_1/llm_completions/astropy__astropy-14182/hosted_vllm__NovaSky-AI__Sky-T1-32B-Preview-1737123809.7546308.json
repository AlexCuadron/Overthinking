Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute.

Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

The `write` method is overridden to add the header and footer lines using the first header line.\n\nNow, the error in the PR description indicates that when trying to pass `header_rows=[\"name\", \"unit\"]` to the `write` method, it raises a `TypeError` because the `RST` writer doesn't accept that keyword argument.\n\nSo, my task is to modify the `RST` writer to accept the `header_rows` keyword argument and use it appropriately in the output.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what `header_rows` is supposed to do. From the PR description, it seems like `header_rows` is a list of strings that represent additional header rows to be included above the main header.\n\nFor example, in the provided code snippet:\n\n```python\ntbl.write(sys.stdout, format=\"ascii.rst\", header_rows=[\"name\", \"unit\"])\n```\n\nThis should add an extra row with \"name\" and \"unit\" above the main header row.\n\nSo, in the output, it should look something like this:\n\n```\n===== ========\nname  unit\n===== ========\nwave  response\n===== ========\n350.0      0.7\n950.0      1.2\n===== ========\n```\n\nWait, but in the example, it's a single additional row with \"name\" and \"unit\". But in the desired output, it's shown as two separate rows. I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back at the PR description, the user provided an example for `ascii.fixed_width` with `header_rows=[\"name\", \"unit\"]`, which produced:\n\n```\n|  wave | response |\n|    nm |       ct |\n| 350.0 |      0.7 |\n| 950.0 |      1.2 |\n```\n\nSo, in the fixed-width format, it added an extra row with units below the column names.\n\nIn the RST format, they want similar behavior: to be able to add additional header rows, such as names and units.\n\nSo, in the RST output, it should look like:\n\n```\n===== ========\nwave  response\n----- -------\n  nm       ct\n===== ========\n350.0      0.7\n950.0      1.2\n===== ========\n```\n\nWait, but in the fixed-width example, it's shown as:\n\n```\n|  wave | response |\n|    nm |       ct |\n| 350.0 |      0.7 |\n| 950.0 |      1.2 |\n```\n\nSo, in RST format, it should have multiple header rows, not just one.\n\nBut in the current `RST` writer, it only supports a single header row.\n\nTherefore, I need to modify the `RST` writer to accept multiple header rows via the `header_rows` keyword argument and include them in the output.\n\nFirst, I need to modify the `RST` writer's `__init__` method to accept the `header_rows` argument.\n\nThen, in the `write` method, I need to incorporate these additional header rows into the output.\n\nBut looking at the current `write` method, it seems to assume a single header row.\n\nI need to adjust it to handle multiple header rows.\n\nAlso, in RST simple tables, header rows are typically separated by lines of equals signs (`=`) and dashes (`-`).\n\nSo, for multiple header rows, I need to insert additional lines with dashes (`-`) between the header rows.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n===== ========\nwave  response\n----- -------\n  nm       ct\n===== ========\n350.0      0.7\n950.0      1.2\n===== ========\n```\n\nHere, the first header row is separated by `===== ========`, then the second header row is separated by `----- -------`, and then the data rows follow.\n\nSo, in code, I need to generate the header rows with alternating lines of `=` and `-`.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the `header_rows` argument in the `RST` writer's `__init__` method.\n\nThen, in the `write` method, I need to generate the header lines accordingly.\n\nI need to modify the `write` method to handle multiple header rows.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the column widths are consistent across all header rows and the data rows.\n\nThis might require adjusting the way column widths are determined.\n\nLet me look at the current `write` method:\n\n```python\ndef write(self, lines):\n    lines = super().write(lines)\n    lines = [lines[1]] + lines + [lines[1]]\n    return lines\n```\n\nThis seems to be adding the second line (which is the header separator) before and after the table lines.\n\nIn the case of multiple header rows, I need to adjust this.\n\nI need to generate additional header separator lines for each additional header row.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1.

Generate the appropriate separator lines for each header row.\n\n4. Insert the additional header rows and their separators before the main header row.\n\n5. Ensure that the column widths accommodate the longest entries in any row, including the additional header rows.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me start by modifying the `RST` writer to accept `header_rows`.\n\nI'll add `header_rows` as a parameter to the `__init__` method and store it as an instance variable.\n\nThen, in the `write` method, I'll need to generate the additional header rows and separators.\n\nI need to think about how to generate the separator lines.\n\nIn RST simple tables, the header separators are lines of `=`, and row separators are lines of `-`.\n\nSo, for multiple header rows, I need to alternate between `=` and `-`.\n\nFor example, if there are two header rows, the first separator is `=`, the second is `-`.\n\nThen, the data rows are separated by `=` at the bottom.\n\nAlright, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll modify the `RST` class to accept `header_rows`.\n\nI'll add a parameter `header_rows` to the `__init__` method.\n\nThen, in the `write` method, I'll need to generate the additional header rows and separators.\n\nI need to adjust the `write` method to handle this.\n\nLet me try to write some code.\n\nI'll need to edit `rst.py`.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/astropy__astropy__5.1/astropy/io/ascii/rst.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>\nclass RST(FixedWidth):\n    \"\"\"reStructuredText simple format table.\n</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>\nclass RST(FixedWidth):\n    \"\"\"reStructuredText simple format table.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    header_rows : list of lists, optional\n        Additional header rows to include in the table.\n</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1545, "prompt_tokens": 5445, "total_tokens": 6990, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"]}, "timestamp": 1737123809.7546358, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Ensure that the column widths accommodate the longest entries in any row, including the additional header rows.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me start by modifying the `RST` writer to accept `header_rows`.\n\nI'll add `header_rows` as a parameter to the `__init__` method and store it as an instance variable.\n\nThen, in the `write` method, I'll need to generate the additional header rows and separators.\n\nI need to think about how to generate the separator lines.\n\nIn RST simple tables, the header separators are lines of `=`, and row separators are lines of `-`.\n\nSo, for multiple header rows, I need to alternate between `=` and `-`.\n\nFor example, if there are two header rows, the first separator is `=`, the second is `-`.\n\nThen, the data rows are separated by `=` at the bottom.\n\nAlright, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll modify the `RST` class to accept `header_rows`.\n\nI'll add a parameter `header_rows` to the `__init__` method.\n\nThen, in the `write` method, I'll need to generate the additional header rows and separators.\n\nI need to adjust the `write` method to handle this.\n\nLet me try to write some code.\n\nI'll need to edit `rst.py`.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/astropy__astropy__5.1/astropy/io/ascii/rst.py\", \"old_str\": \"class RST(FixedWidth):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"reStructuredText simple format table.\", \"new_str\": \"class RST(FixedWidth):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"reStructuredText simple format table.\\n    \\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    header_rows : list of lists, optional\\n        Additional header rows to include in the table.\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_06", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1545, "prompt_tokens": 5445, "total_tokens": 6990, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
