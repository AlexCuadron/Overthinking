Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nbulk_update() does not work with plain F('...') expressions.\nDescription\n\t\nRepro:\nassign plain F(...) to some model instance field\nsave with bulk_update\nExample:\nCode highlighting:\n>>> from exampleapp.models import SelfRef\n>>> o = SelfRef.objects.all().first()\n>>> o.c8 = F('name')\t# model has char fields 'c8' and 'name'\n>>> SelfRef.objects.bulk_update([o], ['c8'])\n1\n>>> o.refresh_from_db()\n>>> o.c8\n'F(name)'\n>>> from django.db import connection\n>>> connection.queries[-2]\n{'sql': 'UPDATE \"exampleapp_selfref\" SET \"c8\" = CASE WHEN (\"exampleapp_selfref\".\"id\" = 1290012) THEN \\'F(name)\\' ELSE NULL END WHERE \"exampleapp_selfref\".\"id\" IN (1290012)', 'time': '0.001'}\nThe created SQL contains the string repr of F(), instead of resolving to the column name. Looking at the source code, the culprit seems to be a too narrow type check in \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2eed554c3fd75dae1beade79f357ffd18d3c4fdf/django/db/models/query.py#L673.\nIt works, if the type check gets replaced by one of these:\nCode highlighting:\n# either do duck type testing\nif not hasattr(attr, 'resolve_expression'):\n\t...\n# or test for F explicitly:\nif not isinstance(attr, (Expression, F)):\n\t...\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2.

The problem is with the `bulk_update()` function not working properly with plain `F('...')` expressions. From the PR description, it seems like when you try to update a model instance using `F()` to reference another field, and then use `bulk_update()`, it doesn't work as expected. Instead of updating the field with the value from another column, it just sets the field to the string representation of the `F()` expression, which is \"F(name)\" in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. `F()` expressions in Django are used to refer to database column values in queries without fetching them to Python. They are useful for performing database-level operations, like incrementing a field's value without knowing its current Python value.\n\nSo, in this scenario, someone is trying to use `F('name')` to set another field `c8` on the same model instance and then using `bulk_update()` to save this change. But instead of updating `c8` with the value from `name`, it's setting `c8` to the string 'F(name)'.\n\nLooking at the code snippet provided in the PR description, the issue seems to be in the `bulk_update()` method of the queryset. Specifically, in the Django source code at `django/db/models/query.py` line 673, there's a type check that's too narrow, causing it to treat the `F()` expression as a plain string instead of resolving it to the actual column value.\n\nThe PR suggests two possible solutions:\n\n1. Use duck typing to check if the attribute has a `resolve_expression` method, which `F()` expressions should have.\n\n2. Explicitly check if the attribute is an instance of `Expression` or `F`.\n\nI need to locate the `bulk_update()` method in the Django source code and modify the relevant part to handle `F()` expressions correctly.\n\nBut before diving into code, I should set up the environment and reproduce the issue to understand it better.\n\nFirst, I need to explore the repository structure. The uploaded file is in `/workspace/django__django__4.1`. I should navigate to this directory and see what's inside.\n\nI can use the `execute_bash` function to run commands in the terminal.\n\nLet me start by checking the current directory and listing its contents.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>cd /workspace/django__django__4.1 && pwd && ls</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n/workspace/django__django__4.1\nAUTHORS  CONTRIBUTING.rst  Django.egg-info  Gruntfile.js  INSTALL  LICENSE  LICENSE.python  MANIFEST.in  README.rst  django  docs  extras  js_tests  package.json  pyproject.toml  scripts  setup.cfg  setup.py  tests  tox.ini\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so the repository contains the standard Django files and directories.

The problem is with the `bulk_update()` function not working properly with plain `F('...')` expressions. From the PR description, it seems like when you try to update a model instance using `F()` to reference another field, and then use `bulk_update()`, it doesn't work as expected. Instead of updating the field with the value from another column, it just sets the field to the string representation of the `F()` expression, which is \"F(name)\" in this case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. `F()` expressions in Django are used to refer to database column values in queries without fetching them to Python. They are useful for performing database-level operations, like incrementing a field's value without knowing its current Python value.\n\nSo, in this scenario, someone is trying to use `F('name')` to set another field `c8` on the same model instance and then using `bulk_update()` to save this change. But instead of updating `c8` with the value from `name`, it's setting `c8` to the string 'F(name)'.\n\nLooking at the code snippet provided in the PR description, the issue seems to be in the `bulk_update()` method of the queryset. Specifically, in the Django source code at `django/db/models/query.py` line 673, there's a type check that's too narrow, causing it to treat the `F()` expression as a plain string instead of resolving it to the actual column value.\n\nThe PR suggests two possible solutions:\n\n1. Use duck typing to check if the attribute has a `resolve_expression` method, which `F()` expressions should have.\n\n2. Explicitly check if the attribute is an instance of `Expression` or `F`.\n\nI need to locate the `bulk_update()` method in the Django source code and modify the relevant part to handle `F()` expressions correctly.\n\nBut before diving into code, I should set up the environment and reproduce the issue to understand it better.\n\nFirst, I need to explore the repository structure.
