The problem is that when you use `inspect.signature()` on certain queryset methods, it returns incorrect signature information. Specifically, for `Person.objects.bulk_create`, it shows `(*args, **kwargs)` instead of the expected `(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Django uses a lot of metaprogramming and decorators, which can mess with the function signatures. The PR description points to a specific part of the manager.py file where the issue originates.\n\nI should start by looking at the Django source code in the provided repository. The repository path is `/workspace/django__django__4.2`. I need to navigate to this directory and explore the files to find the relevant code.\n\nLet me first check the directory structure to see where the manager.py file is located. In Django, manager.py is probably under `django/db/models/manager.py`.\n\nI should also recall that in Django, model managers handle the queryset operations. So, the `objects` attribute on the `Person` model is an instance of a manager, and `bulk_create` is a method on that manager.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the signature of `bulk_create` is not being preserved correctly when it's called on the manager. The PR description suggests that using `functools.wraps` instead of manually assigning the name and docstring would solve this problem.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to reproduce the error. I'll write a small Python script that defines a simple Django model, tries to inspect the signature of a manager method, and prints it out.\n\nI should set up a minimal Django project for this purpose. I need to have Django installed and create a model similar to the one in the PR description.\n\nWait, but the repository already contains Django source code. Maybe I can run a test script within this repository to reproduce the issue.\n\nLet me try to create a new Python file in the /workspace directory, say `test_signature.py`, and write the code there.\n\nHere's what the script might look like:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nprint(inspect.signature(Person.objects.bulk_create))\n```\n\nAccording to the PR description, this should print `(*args, **kwargs)`, but we expect `(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)`.\n\nI need to run this script in the Django environment. Since it's a Python script, I can use the `execute_bash` function to run `python test_signature.py`.\n\nBut before that, I need to make sure that Django is set up correctly and that the script can be executed without errors.\n\nWait, actually, I need to set up a Django project properly to run this script. Maybe I should create a new Django project within the /workspace directory.\n\nLet me use the `execute_bash` function to create a new Django project.\n\nFirst, I need to install Django. But since this is a Django repository, maybe Django is already installed.\n\nWait, the repository is the Django source code itself. So, perhaps I need to install it in develop mode.\n\nLet me check the directory structure.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__4.2</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\nAUTHORS  CONTRIBUTING.rst  Django.egg-info  Gruntfile.js  INSTALL  LICENSE  LICENSE.python  MANIFEST.in  README.rst  django  docs  extras  js_tests  package.json  pyproject.toml  scripts  setup.cfg  setup.py  tests  tox.ini\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, so the /workspace/django__django__4.2 directory contains the Django source code.

The problem is that when you use `inspect.signature()` on certain queryset methods, it returns incorrect signature information. Specifically, for `Person.objects.bulk_create`, it shows `(*args, **kwargs)` instead of the expected `(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Django uses a lot of metaprogramming and decorators, which can mess with the function signatures. The PR description points to a specific part of the manager.py file where the issue originates.\n\nI should start by looking at the Django source code in the provided repository. The repository path is `/workspace/django__django__4.2`. I need to navigate to this directory and explore the files to find the relevant code.\n\nLet me first check the directory structure to see where the manager.py file is located. In Django, manager.py is probably under `django/db/models/manager.py`.\n\nI should also recall that in Django, model managers handle the queryset operations. So, the `objects` attribute on the `Person` model is an instance of a manager, and `bulk_create` is a method on that manager.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the signature of `bulk_create` is not being preserved correctly when it's called on the manager. The PR description suggests that using `functools.wraps` instead of manually assigning the name and docstring would solve this problem.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to reproduce the error. I'll write a small Python script that defines a simple Django model, tries to inspect the signature of a manager method, and prints it out.\n\nI should set up a minimal Django project for this purpose. I need to have Django installed and create a model similar to the one in the PR description.\n\nWait, but the repository already contains Django source code. Maybe I can run a test script within this repository to reproduce the issue.\n\nLet me try to create a new Python file in the /workspace directory, say `test_signature.py`, and write the code there.\n\nHere's what the script might look like:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nprint(inspect.signature(Person.objects.bulk_create))\n```\n\nAccording to the PR description, this should print `(*args, **kwargs)`, but we expect `(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)`.\n\nI need to run this script in the Django environment. Since it's a Python script, I can use the `execute_bash` function to run `python test_signature.py`.\n\nBut before that, I need to make sure that Django is set up correctly and that the script can be executed without errors.\n\nWait, actually, I need to set up a Django project properly to run this script. Maybe I should create a new Django project within the /workspace directory.\n\nLet me use the `execute_bash` function to create a new Django project.\n\nFirst, I need to install Django. But since this is a Django repository, maybe Django is already installed.\n\nWait, the repository is the Django source code itself. So, perhaps I need to install it in develop mode.\n\nLet me check the directory structure.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"ls /workspace/django__django__4.2\"}"}}]}, {"content": "AUTHORS  CONTRIBUTING.rst  Django.egg-info  Gruntfile.js  INSTALL  LICENSE  LICENSE.python  MANIFEST.in  README.rst  django  docs  extras  js_tests  package.json  pyproject.toml  scripts  setup.cfg  setup.py  tests  tox.ini\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nOkay, so the /workspace/django__django__4.2 directory contains the Django source code.
