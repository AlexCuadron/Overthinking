      "response": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nAlright, I've got this task to fix an issue in a Django repository. The problem is that when using the admin site, there's an issue with redirects not preserving the query string when APPEND_SLASH is set to True. So, for example, if you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo?id=123, it should redirect to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo/?id=123, but instead, it's redirecting to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo/ without the query string.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Django has a setting called APPEND_SLASH, which is usually set to True. This means that if you request a URL that doesn't have a trailing slash, but there's a pattern that matches with a trailing slash, Django will automatically redirect you to that URL with the trailing slash.\n\nIn this case, it seems like the redirect is happening correctly in terms of adding the trailing slash, but it's dropping the query string. So, I need to make sure that when the redirect occurs, it includes the original query string.\n\nLooking at the code snippet provided in the PR description, the redirect is being done using `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`. This means that it's constructing the redirect URL by taking the current path and appending a slash to it, but it's not including the query string from the original request.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the redirect so that it includes the original query string. In Django, the request object has a META dictionary that contains various headers and environment variables, including 'QUERY_STRING', which holds the query string part of the URL.\n\nSo, one way to include the query string in the redirect is to construct the redirect URL by appending the query string to the modified path. In Python, I can do this by accessing `request.META['QUERY_STRING']` and appending it to the redirect URL if it exists.\n\nLet me think about how to do this properly. If the query string is empty, I don't need to append a question mark followed by nothing. So, I need to check if there's a query string and include it only if it's present.\n\nIn Python, I can do something like this:\n\n```python\nquery_string = request.META.get('QUERY_STRING')\nredirect_url = \"%s/\" % request.path\nif query_string:\n    redirect_url += \"?\" + query_string\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the query string is appended to the redirect URL only if it exists.\n\nBut, I should check if there's a better or more Django-way of handling this. Maybe there's a utility function in Django that can help construct the redirect URL while preserving the query string.\n\nLooking through the Django documentation, I see that there's a `HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri` method that can be used to build the absolute URI for a given location, and it automatically includes the query string if present.\n\nHowever, in this case, since we're modifying the path and adding a trailing slash, I need to construct the URL manually.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use `HttpRequest.get_full_path` to get the full path including the query string, and then modify it as needed.\n\n`request.get_full_path()` returns the path with the query string, if present. So, for example, if the request is http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo?id=123, `request.get_full_path()` would return \"/admin/auth/foo?id=123\".\n\nThen, I can manipulate this string to add the trailing slash before the query string.\n\nLet me try to think of a way to do that.\n\nIf I have the full path, say \"/admin/auth/foo?id=123\", I need to add a slash before the query string, so it becomes \"/admin/auth/foo/?id=123\".\n\nIn Python, I can split the full path into path and query string, add the slash to the path, and then recombine them.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis seems cleaner and more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, Django might have a utility to handle this kind of URL manipulation.\n\nI should check if there's a way to use the `urlparse` module from the Python standard library to handle this.\n\nUsing `urlparse`, I can parse the full URL, modify the path, and then reconstruct the URL.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse\n\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\nparsed_url = urlparse(full_path)\nnew_path = parsed_url.path + '/'\nredirect_url = urlunparse((\n    parsed_url.scheme,\n    parsed_url.netloc,\n    new_path,\n    parsed_url.params,\n    parsed_url.query,\n    parsed_url.fragment\n))\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis seems a bit verbose, but it might be more robust.\n\nHowever, since I'm only modifying the path and ensuring the query string is preserved, the first approach might be sufficient.\n\nI need to decide which one to use. The first approach is simpler and easier to read, so I'll go with that for now.\n\nSo, the modified code would look like this:\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nBefore making this change, I should verify that this indeed solves the problem.\n\nLet me think about how to test this.\n\nI need to set up a Django project with the admin site, set APPEND_SLASH to True, and then make a request to a URL without a trailing slash that should be redirected to a URL with a trailing slash, while preserving the query string.\n\nI can create a minimal Django project for this purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to create a new Django project and app, add the app to INSTALLED_APPS, set up the admin site, and configure APPEND_SLASH to True in settings.\n\nThen, I can run the development server and make a request to a URL like /admin/auth/foo?id=123 and see if it redirects to /admin/auth/foo/?id=123.\n\nIf it does, then the fix is working. If not, I need to debug further.\n\nAlso, I need to consider edge cases, such as:\n\n- URLs without query strings\n- URLs that already have trailing slashes\n- URLs with multiple query parameters\n- URLs with special characters in the query string\n\nI need to make sure that the fix handles all these cases correctly.\n\nLet me think about how to handle URLs that already have trailing slashes. In that case, Django shouldn't redirect if APPEND_SLASH is True, because the URL already has a trailing slash.\n\nSo, in the fix, I need to ensure that we only add the trailing slash and preserve the query string when the original URL doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nBut, in the `catch_all_view`, it's likely that this view is only called when the URL doesn't match any patterns, and APPEND_SLASH is True, and the URL doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nSo, in this specific case, adding the trailing slash and preserving the query string should be sufficient.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the fix doesn't break any existing functionality.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there are any security implications, such as injecting malicious query strings or something like that. But, since we're just preserving the original query string, I don't think there should be any security issues.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the query string has multiple parameters, or if it has special characters, like ampersands or equals signs. The partition method should handle this correctly, as it only splits on the first '?'.\n\nWait, actually, in the partition method, it splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. So, `full_path.partition('?')` would give me (`path`, '?', `query_string`), even if the query string has multiple parameters or special characters.\n\nSo, that should be fine.\n\nLet me think about URLs with multiple query parameters, like ?id=123&name=foo. The partition method should still work correctly, as it only splits on the first '?'.\n\nWait, actually, no. The partition method splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. So, for `full_path.partition('?')`, it would correctly separate the path from the query string, even if the query string has multiple parameters.\n\nSo, that should be okay.\n\nAnother edge case is if the query string has a question mark in it, but that would be invalid, as the query string is separated by '&', not another '?'. So, I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, if there is no query string, the partition method will return the full path, an empty string for the separator, and another empty string for the query string. So, in that case, redirect_url would be `path + '/'`, which is correct.\n\nSo, it seems like this approach handles most of the edge cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to find where in the code this redirect is happening.\n\nLooking at the PR description, it mentions that the issue was introduced in #31747, which added `AdminSite.catch_all_view()`. The specific line causing the issue is in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, line 456, where it returns `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`.\n\nSo, I need to modify this line to include the query string, as discussed earlier.\n\nI need to edit the `catch_all_view` function in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` to construct the redirect URL correctly.\n\nBefore making the change, I should look at the surrounding code to understand the context.\n\nLet me assume that I have access to the Django source code in the `/workspace/django__django__5.0` directory.\n\nI need to navigate to that directory and find the `sites.py` file.\n\nOnce I find the file, I can locate line 456 and modify the redirect construction.\n\nBut, since I'm working in a code repository, I need to make sure that I'm making the minimal changes required and not altering any other parts of the code.\n\nAlso, since the user has already taken care of the test changes, I don't need to modify any test files.\n\nMy task is only to modify the necessary source code files to fix the issue described.\n\nSo, in summary, the steps are:\n\n1. Explore the repository to understand its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and confirm it.\n3. Edit the source code to fix the issue.\n4.

      "response": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nAlright, I've got this task to fix an issue in a Django repository. The problem is that when using the admin site, there's an issue with redirects not preserving the query string when APPEND_SLASH is set to True. So, for example, if you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo?id=123, it should redirect to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo/?id=123, but instead, it's redirecting to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo/ without the query string.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Django has a setting called APPEND_SLASH, which is usually set to True. This means that if you request a URL that doesn't have a trailing slash, but there's a pattern that matches with a trailing slash, Django will automatically redirect you to that URL with the trailing slash.\n\nIn this case, it seems like the redirect is happening correctly in terms of adding the trailing slash, but it's dropping the query string. So, I need to make sure that when the redirect occurs, it includes the original query string.\n\nLooking at the code snippet provided in the PR description, the redirect is being done using `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`. This means that it's constructing the redirect URL by taking the current path and appending a slash to it, but it's not including the query string from the original request.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the redirect so that it includes the original query string. In Django, the request object has a META dictionary that contains various headers and environment variables, including 'QUERY_STRING', which holds the query string part of the URL.\n\nSo, one way to include the query string in the redirect is to construct the redirect URL by appending the query string to the modified path. In Python, I can do this by accessing `request.META['QUERY_STRING']` and appending it to the redirect URL if it exists.\n\nLet me think about how to do this properly. If the query string is empty, I don't need to append a question mark followed by nothing. So, I need to check if there's a query string and include it only if it's present.\n\nIn Python, I can do something like this:\n\n```python\nquery_string = request.META.get('QUERY_STRING')\nredirect_url = \"%s/\" % request.path\nif query_string:\n    redirect_url += \"?\" + query_string\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the query string is appended to the redirect URL only if it exists.\n\nBut, I should check if there's a better or more Django-way of handling this. Maybe there's a utility function in Django that can help construct the redirect URL while preserving the query string.\n\nLooking through the Django documentation, I see that there's a `HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri` method that can be used to build the absolute URI for a given location, and it automatically includes the query string if present.\n\nHowever, in this case, since we're modifying the path and adding a trailing slash, I need to construct the URL manually.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use `HttpRequest.get_full_path` to get the full path including the query string, and then modify it as needed.\n\n`request.get_full_path()` returns the path with the query string, if present. So, for example, if the request is http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo?id=123, `request.get_full_path()` would return \"/admin/auth/foo?id=123\".\n\nThen, I can manipulate this string to add the trailing slash before the query string.\n\nLet me try to think of a way to do that.\n\nIf I have the full path, say \"/admin/auth/foo?id=123\", I need to add a slash before the query string, so it becomes \"/admin/auth/foo/?id=123\".\n\nIn Python, I can split the full path into path and query string, add the slash to the path, and then recombine them.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis seems cleaner and more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, Django might have a utility function to handle this kind of URL manipulation.\n\nI should check if there's a way to use the `urlparse` module from the Python standard library to handle this.\n\nUsing `urlparse`, I can parse the full URL, modify the path, and then reconstruct the URL.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse\n\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\nparsed_url = urlparse(full_path)\nnew_path = parsed_url.path + '/'\nredirect_url = urlunparse((\n    parsed_url.scheme,\n    parsed_url.netloc,\n    new_path,\n    parsed_url.params,\n    parsed_url.query,\n    parsed_url.fragment\n))\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis seems a bit verbose, but it might be more robust.\n\nHowever, since I'm only modifying the path and ensuring the query string is preserved, the first approach might be sufficient.\n\nI need to decide which one to use. The first approach is simpler and easier to read, so I'll go with that for now.\n\nSo, the modified code would look like this:\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nBefore making this change, I should verify that this indeed solves the problem.\n\nLet me think about how to test this.\n\nI need to set up a Django project with the admin site, set APPEND_SLASH to True, and then make a request to a URL without a trailing slash that should be redirected to a URL with a trailing slash, while preserving the query string.\n\nI can create a minimal Django project for this purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to create a new Django project and app, add the app to INSTALLED_APPS, set up the admin site, and configure APPEND_SLASH to True in settings.\n\nThen, I can run the development server and make a request to a URL like /admin/auth/foo?id=123 and see if it redirects to /admin/auth/foo/?id=123.\n\nIf it does, then the fix is working. If not, I need to debug further.\n\nAlso, I need to consider edge cases, such as:\n\n- URLs without query strings\n- URLs that already have trailing slashes\n- URLs with multiple query parameters\n- URLs with special characters in the query string\n\nI need to make sure that the fix handles all these cases correctly.\n\nLet me think about how to handle URLs that already have trailing slashes. In that case, Django shouldn't redirect if APPEND_SLASH is True, because the URL already has a trailing slash.\n\nSo, in the fix, I need to ensure that we only add the trailing slash and preserve the query string when the original URL doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nBut, in the `catch_all_view`, it's likely that this view is only called when the URL doesn't match any patterns, and APPEND_SLASH is True, and the URL doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nSo, in this specific case, adding the trailing slash and preserving the query string should be sufficient.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the fix doesn't break any existing functionality.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there are any security implications, such as injecting malicious query strings or something like that. But, since we're just preserving the original query string, I don't think there should be any security issues.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the query string has multiple parameters, or if it has special characters, like ampersands or equals signs. The partition method should handle this correctly, as it only splits on the first '?'.\n\nWait, actually, in the partition method, it splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. So, `full_path.partition('?')` would give me (`path`, '?', `query_string`), even if the query string has multiple parameters.\n\nSo, that should be fine.\n\nLet me think about URLs with multiple query parameters, like ?id=123&name=foo. The partition method should still work correctly, as it only splits on the first '?'.\n\nWait, actually, no. The partition method splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. So, for `full_path.partition('?')`, it would correctly separate the path from the query string, even if the query string has multiple parameters.\n\nSo, that should be okay.\n\nAnother edge case is if the query string has a question mark in it, but that would be invalid, as the query string is separated by '&', not another '?'. So, I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, if there is no query string, the partition method will return the full path, an empty string for the separator, and another empty string for the query string. So, in that case, redirect_url would be `path + '/'`, which is correct.\n\nSo, it seems like this approach handles most of the edge cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to find where in the code this redirect is happening.\n\nLooking at the PR description, it mentions that the issue was introduced in #31747, which added `AdminSite.catch_all_view()`. The specific line causing the issue is in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, line 456, where it returns `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`.\n\nSo, I need to modify this line to include the query string, as discussed earlier.\n\nI need to edit the `catch_all_view` function in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` to construct the redirect URL correctly.\n\nBefore making the change, I should look at the surrounding code to understand the context.\n\nLet me assume that I have access to the Django source code in the `/workspace/django__django__5.0` directory.\n\nI need to navigate to that directory and find the `sites.py` file.\n\nOnce I find the file, I can locate line 456 and modify the redirect construction.\n\nBut, since I'm working in a code repository, I need to make sure that I'm making the minimal changes required and not altering any other parts of the code.\n\nAlso, since the user has already taken care of the test changes, I don't need to modify any test files.\n\nMy task is only to modify the necessary source code files to fix the issue described.\n\nSo, in summary, the steps are:\n\n1. Explore the repository to understand its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and confirm it.\n3. Edit the source code to fix the issue.\n4.

  "final_response": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nAlright, I've got this task to fix an issue in a Django repository. The problem is that when using the admin site, there's an issue with redirects not preserving the query string when APPEND_SLASH is set to True. So, for example, if you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo?id=123, it should redirect to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo/?id=123, but instead, it's redirecting to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo/ without the query string.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Django has a setting called APPEND_SLASH, which is usually set to True. This means that if you request a URL that doesn't have a trailing slash, but there's a pattern that matches with a trailing slash, Django will automatically redirect you to that URL with the trailing slash.\n\nIn this case, it seems like the redirect is happening correctly in terms of adding the trailing slash, but it's dropping the query string. So, I need to make sure that when the redirect occurs, it includes the original query string.\n\nLooking at the code snippet provided in the PR description, the redirect is being done using `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`. This means that it's constructing the redirect URL by taking the current path and appending a slash to it, but it's not including the query string from the original request.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the redirect so that it includes the original query string. In Django, the request object has a META dictionary that contains various headers and environment variables, including 'QUERY_STRING', which holds the query string part of the URL.\n\nSo, one way to include the query string in the redirect is to construct the redirect URL by appending the query string to the modified path. In Python, I can do this by accessing `request.META['QUERY_STRING']` and appending it to the redirect URL if it exists.\n\nLet me think about how to do this properly. If the query string is empty, I don't need to append a question mark followed by nothing. So, I need to check if there's a query string and include it only if it's present.\n\nIn Python, I can do something like this:\n\n```python\nquery_string = request.META.get('QUERY_STRING')\nredirect_url = \"%s/\" % request.path\nif query_string:\n    redirect_url += \"?\" + query_string\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis should ensure that the query string is appended to the redirect URL only if it exists.\n\nBut, I should check if there's a better or more Django-way of handling this. Maybe there's a utility function in Django that can help construct the redirect URL while preserving the query string.\n\nLooking through the Django documentation, I see that there's a `HttpRequest.build_absolute_uri` method that can be used to build the absolute URI for a given location, and it automatically includes the query string if present.\n\nHowever, in this case, since we're modifying the path and adding a trailing slash, I need to construct the URL manually.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use `HttpRequest.get_full_path` to get the full path including the query string, and then modify it as needed.\n\n`request.get_full_path()` returns the path with the query string, if present. So, for example, if the request is http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/foo?id=123, `request.get_full_path()` would return \"/admin/auth/foo?id=123\".\n\nThen, I can manipulate this string to add the trailing slash before the query string.\n\nLet me try to think of a way to do that.\n\nIf I have the full path, say \"/admin/auth/foo?id=123\", I need to add a slash before the query string, so it becomes \"/admin/auth/foo/?id=123\".\n\nIn Python, I can split the full path into path and query string, add the slash to the path, and then recombine them.\n\nSomething like:\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis seems cleaner and more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, Django might have a utility to handle this kind of URL manipulation.\n\nI should check if there's a way to use the `urlparse` module from the Python standard library to handle this.\n\nUsing `urlparse`, I can parse the full URL, modify the path, and then reconstruct the URL.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse\n\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\nparsed_url = urlparse(full_path)\nnew_path = parsed_url.path + '/'\nredirect_url = urlunparse((\n    parsed_url.scheme,\n    parsed_url.netloc,\n    new_path,\n    parsed_url.params,\n    parsed_url.query,\n    parsed_url.fragment\n))\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nThis seems a bit verbose, but it might be more robust.\n\nHowever, since I'm only modifying the path and ensuring the query string is preserved, the first approach might be sufficient.\n\nI need to decide which one to use. The first approach is simpler and easier to read, so I'll go with that for now.\n\nSo, the modified code would look like this:\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\nBefore making this change, I should verify that this indeed solves the problem.\n\nLet me think about how to test this.\n\nI need to set up a Django project with the admin site, set APPEND_SLASH to True, and then make a request to a URL without a trailing slash that should be redirected to a URL with a trailing slash, while preserving the query string.\n\nI can create a minimal Django project for this purpose.\n\nFirst, I need to create a new Django project and app, add the app to INSTALLED_APPS, set up the admin site, and configure APPEND_SLASH to True in settings.\n\nThen, I can run the development server and make a request to a URL like /admin/auth/foo?id=123 and see if it redirects to /admin/auth/foo/?id=123.\n\nIf it does, then the fix is working. If not, I need to debug further.\n\nAlso, I need to consider edge cases, such as:\n\n- URLs without query strings\n- URLs that already have trailing slashes\n- URLs with multiple query parameters\n- URLs with special characters in the query string\n\nI need to make sure that the fix handles all these cases correctly.\n\nLet me think about how to handle URLs that already have trailing slashes. In that case, Django shouldn't redirect if APPEND_SLASH is True, because the URL already has a trailing slash.\n\nSo, in the fix, I need to ensure that we only add the trailing slash and preserve the query string when the original URL doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nBut, in the `catch_all_view`, it's likely that this view is only called when the URL doesn't match any patterns, and APPEND_SLASH is True, and the URL doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nSo, in this specific case, adding the trailing slash and preserving the query string should be sufficient.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the fix doesn't break any existing functionality.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there are any security implications, such as injecting malicious query strings or something like that. But, since we're just preserving the original query string, I don't think there should be any security issues.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if the query string has multiple parameters, or if it has special characters, like ampersands or equals signs. The partition method should handle this correctly, as it only splits on the first '?'.\n\nWait, actually, in the partition method, it splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. So, `full_path.partition('?')` would give me (`path`, '?', `query_string`), even if the query string has multiple parameters or special characters.\n\nSo, that should be fine.\n\nLet me think about URLs with multiple query parameters, like ?id=123&name=foo. The partition method should still work correctly, as it only splits on the first '?'.\n\nWait, actually, no. The partition method splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. So, for `full_path.partition('?')`, it would correctly separate the path from the query string, even if the query string has multiple parameters.\n\nSo, that should be okay.\n\nAnother edge case is if the query string has a question mark in it, but that would be invalid, as the query string is separated by '&', not another '?'. So, I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, if there is no query string, the partition method will return the full path, an empty string for the separator, and another empty string for the query string. So, in that case, redirect_url would be `path + '/'`, which is correct.\n\nSo, it seems like this approach handles most of the edge cases correctly.\n\nNow, I need to find where in the code this redirect is happening.\n\nLooking at the PR description, it mentions that the issue was introduced in #31747, which added `AdminSite.catch_all_view()`. The specific line causing the issue is in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, line 456, where it returns `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`.\n\nSo, I need to modify this line to include the query string, as discussed earlier.\n\nI need to edit the `catch_all_view` function in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` to construct the redirect URL correctly.\n\nBefore making the change, I should look at the surrounding code to understand the context.\n\nLet me assume that I have access to the Django source code in the `/workspace/django__django__5.0` directory.\n\nI need to navigate to that directory and find the `sites.py` file.\n\nOnce I find the file, I can locate line 456 and modify the redirect construction.\n\nBut, since I'm working in a code repository, I need to make sure that I'm making the minimal changes required and not altering any other parts of the code.\n\nAlso, since the user has already taken care of the test changes, I don't need to modify any test files.\n\nMy task is only to modify the necessary source code files to fix the issue described.\n\nSo, in summary, the steps are:\n\n1. Explore the repository to understand its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and confirm it.\n3. Edit the source code to fix the issue.\n4. Rerun the reproduce script to confirm the fix.\n5. Consider edge cases to ensure the fix is robust.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository.\n\nI need to list the contents of the `/workspace/django__django__5.0` directory to see its structure.\n\nI can use the `ls` command for that.\n\nThen, I can navigate into the `django/contrib/admin` directory to find the `sites.py` file.\n\nOnce I have located the file, I can open it and find line 456 to make the necessary changes.\n\nBut, since I'm working in a text-based interface, I need to use commands like `cat`, `nano`, or other text editors to view and edit the file.\n\nI should also make sure that I'm not introducing any new issues and that the fix is clean and minimal.\n\nAfter making the changes, I need to create a script to reproduce the error.\n\nThis script should set up a minimal Django project, enable the admin site, set APPEND_SLASH to True, and make a request to a URL without a trailing slash and with a query string.\n\nThen, it should check if the redirect includes the query string correctly.\n\nIf the fix is applied correctly, the redirect should include the query string as expected.\n\nI need to write this script in Python and run it using the `python` command.\n\nOnce the script is created and run, and it confirms that the issue is fixed, then I can consider the task complete.\n\nI should also think about any potential edge cases and make sure that my fix handles them appropriately.\n\nFor example, URLs with multiple query parameters, URLs with special characters in the query string, URLs that already have trailing slashes, etc.\n\nI need to ensure that the fix doesn't break any existing functionality and only addresses the specific issue described.\n\nAlright, that's my plan. Now, I'll proceed to implement it step by step.<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nTo fix the issue described in the PR, we need to ensure that the `AdminSite.catch_all_view()` function includes the query string in the redirect URL when `APPEND_SLASH` is set to `True`.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue\n\n1. **Locate the `catch_all_view` function**:\n   - The function is located in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` at line 456.\n\n2. **Modify the redirect URL construction**:\n   - The original code constructs the redirect URL using `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(\"%s/\" % request.path)`, which does not include the query string.\n   - We need to include the query string in the redirect URL.\n\n3. **Implement the fix**:\n   - Use `request.get_full_path()` to get the full path including the query string.\n   - Partition the full path to separate the path and the query string.\n   - Construct the redirect URL by adding a trailing slash to the path and reappending the query string if it exists.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfull_path = request.get_full_path()\npath, _, query_string = full_path.partition('?')\nredirect_url = path + '/' + ('?' + query_string if query_string else '')\nreturn HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`request.get_full_path()`**: Retrieves the full path of the request, including the query string.\n- **`partition('?')`**: Splits the full path into the path and query string.\n- **`redirect_url`**: Constructs the redirect URL by adding a trailing slash to the path and appending the query string if it exists.\n- **`HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(redirect_url)`**: Returns the redirect response with the correctly constructed URL.\n\nThis ensures that the query string is preserved in the redirect, addressing the issue described in the PR.",
