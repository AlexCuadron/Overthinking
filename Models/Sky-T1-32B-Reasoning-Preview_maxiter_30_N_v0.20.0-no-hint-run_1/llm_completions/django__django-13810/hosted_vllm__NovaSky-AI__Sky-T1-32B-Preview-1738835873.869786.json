Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nMiddlewareNotUsed leaves undesired side effects when loading middleware in ASGI context\nDescription\n\t\nI experienced strange issues when working with \u200bASGI , \u200bdjango-debug-toolbar and my own small middleware. It was hard problem to debug, I uploaded an example project here: \u200bhttps://github.com/hbielenia/asgi-djangotoolbar-bug (the name is misleading - I initially thought it's a bug with django-debug-toolbar).\nThe SESSION_FILE_PATH setting is intentionally broken to cause a 500 error. When starting the application and accessing /admin (any location really, but I wanted to leave it at a minimum and didn't add any views) it gives TypeError: object HttpResponse can't be used in 'await' expression. Commenting out asgi_djangotoolbar_bug.middleware.DummyMiddleware fixes the issue (in that I receive a 500 ImproperlyConfigured exception). I'm not sure about the overall role of django-debug-toolbar here - removing it causes Daphne to return a 500 error page but without debug information and there's no traceback in console either. I decided to leave it since it helped me approximate the causes of issue.\nI notice that in \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/3.1.4/django/core/handlers/base.py#L58 while MiddlewareNotUsed causes the loop to skip futher processing and go to next middleware, it does leave handler variable overwritten with output of self.adapt_method_mode(). On next pass, this handler is passed to next middleware instance, disregarding all the previous checks for (lack of) async support. This likely causes the middleware chain to be \"poisoned\" from this point onwards, resulting in last middleware in response cycle to return an HttpResponse as a synchronous middleware would, instead of coroutine that is expected.\nThis is probably avoided by adding async support to my middleware, but unless I'm missing something \u200bdocs indicate it should work as it is. It is my intention that it's applied only on synchronous requests, so I didn't make it async compatible on purpose. If it's intentional in Django that every middleware needs to support async if the application is run as ASGI app, the documentation should probably state that clearly. Though it kinda defeats the purpose of having async_capable = False flag in the first place.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n\n<extra_info>\nThe following information has been included based on a keyword match for \"github\".

It wraps synchronous methods with `sync_to_async` if `is_async` is True, and wraps asynchronous methods with `async_to_sync` if `is_async` is False.\n\nIn the context of middleware, `handler` is being adapted based on whether the middleware is asynchronous or not.\n\nThe issue seems to be that when `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the `handler` variable has already been adapted, and this adapted handler is passed to the next middleware, which might not expect it.\n\nI think the problem lies in the order of operations here. The handler is being adapted before the middleware is instantiated, and if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the adapted handler is still being used in the next iteration.\n\nMaybe the adaptation should happen after the middleware is instantiated, or the original handler should be preserved if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nPerhaps I can modify the code to store the original handler and only adapt it if the middleware is actually used.\n\nSomething like:\n\n- Start with the original handler\n\n- For each middleware:\n\n- Adapt the handler based on the middleware's async capabilities\n\n- Instantiate the middleware with the adapted handler\n\n- If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, revert to the original handler for the next middleware\n\nWait, but that might not be straightforward, because the adapted handler is meant to ensure that the middleware is called in the correct mode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can keep track of whether the middleware was actually used and only update the handler if it was.\n\nLet me look at the current code again.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\n```python\nfor middleware_path in settings.MIDDLEWARE:\n    ...\n    try:\n        # Adapt handler, if needed.\n        handler = self.adapt_method_mode(\n            middleware_is_async, handler, handler_is_async,\n            debug=settings.DEBUG, name='middleware %s' % middleware_path,\n        )\n        mw_instance = middleware(handler)\n    except MiddlewareNotUsed as exc:\n        if settings.DEBUG:\n            ...\n        continue\n    ...\n    handler = mw_instance\n```\n\nSo, the handler is adapted and then passed to the middleware constructor. If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, it continues to the next middleware, but the handler has already been adapted.\n\nPerhaps I can delay the adaptation until after the middleware is instantiated, or only apply the adaptation if the middleware is actually used.\n\nLet me try reordering the operations.\n\nSomething like:\n\n- For each middleware:\n\n- Try to instantiate the middleware with the original handler\n\n- If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, skip to the next middleware\n\n- If successful, adapt the handler based on the middleware's async capabilities\n\n- Update the handler to be the instantiated middleware\n\nWait, but in Django, middleware classes can modify the handler in their constructor, and the handler is passed to them so they can wrap it.\n\nI need to ensure that the handler is only adapted if the middleware is actually used.\n\nMaybe I can store the original handler before adapting and only set the handler to the instantiated middleware if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is not raised.\n\nLet me try to refactor this code.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\n```python\noriginal_handler = handler\nfor middleware_path in settings.MIDDLEWARE:\n    ...\n    try:\n        mw_instance = middleware(original_handler)\n    except MiddlewareNotUsed as exc:\n        if settings.DEBUG:\n            ...\n        continue\n    # Adapt handler only if middleware is used\n    handler = self.adapt_method_mode(\n        middleware_is_async, handler, handler_is_async,\n        debug=settings.DEBUG, name='middleware %s' % middleware_path,\n    )\n    handler = mw_instance\n```\n\nIn this version, I pass the original handler to the middleware constructor, and only adapt the handler if the middleware is actually used.\n\nThis way, if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the handler remains unchanged, and the original handler is used for the next middleware.\n\nI need to verify if this approach maintains the intended behavior.\n\nLet me think about the implications.\n\n- If a middleware is marked as `async_capable`, it should adapt the handler to be asynchronous.\n\n- If a middleware is not `async_capable`, it should adapt the handler to be synchronous.\n\n- If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the handler should remain in its previous state.\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nI should also consider the order of the middleware. Middleware is applied in reverse order, so the first middleware in the list is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, in Django, middleware is applied in the order they are defined in `settings.MIDDLEWARE`, with the first-defined being the closest to the view.\n\nBut in the code, it seems like the handler is being wrapped in each middleware's `__call__` method.\n\nI need to make sure that the adaptation is done correctly at each step.\n\nMaybe I should look at the documentation or comments in the code to understand better.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[40, 70]</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py:\n    40\t            middleware = import_string(middleware_path)\n    41\t            middleware_can_sync = getattr(middleware, 'sync_capable', True)\n    42\t            middleware_can_async = getattr(middleware, 'async_capable', False)\n    43\t            if not middleware_can_sync and not middleware_can_async:\n    44\t                raise RuntimeError(\n    45\t                    'Middleware %s must have at least one of '\n    46\t                    'sync_capable/async_capable set to True.' % middleware_path\n    47\t                )\n    48\t            elif not handler_is_async and middleware_can_sync:\n    49\t                middleware_is_async = False\n    50\t            else:\n    51\t                middleware_is_async = middleware_can_async\n    52\t            try:\n    53\t                #

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nMiddlewareNotUsed leaves undesired side effects when loading middleware in ASGI context\nDescription\n\t\nI experienced strange issues when working with \u200bASGI , \u200bdjango-debug-toolbar and my own small middleware. It was hard problem to debug, I uploaded an example project here: \u200bhttps://github.com/hbielenia/asgi-djangotoolbar-bug (the name is misleading - I initially thought it's a bug with django-debug-toolbar).\nThe SESSION_FILE_PATH setting is intentionally broken to cause a 500 error. When starting the application and accessing /admin (any location really, but I wanted to leave it at a minimum and didn't add any views) it gives TypeError: object HttpResponse can't be used in 'await' expression. Commenting out asgi_djangotoolbar_bug.middleware.DummyMiddleware fixes the issue (in that I receive a 500 ImproperlyConfigured exception). I'm not sure about the overall role of django-debug-toolbar here - removing it causes Daphne to return a 500 error page but without debug information and there's no traceback in console either. I decided to leave it since it helped me approximate the causes of issue.\nI notice that in \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/3.1.4/django/core/handlers/base.py#L58 while MiddlewareNotUsed causes the loop to skip futher processing and go to next middleware, it does leave handler variable overwritten with output of self.adapt_method_mode(). On next pass, this handler is passed to next middleware instance, disregarding all the previous checks for (lack of) async support. This likely causes the middleware chain to be \"poisoned\" from this point onwards, resulting in last middleware in response cycle to return an HttpResponse as a synchronous middleware would, instead of coroutine that is expected.\nThis is probably avoided by adding async support to my middleware, but unless I'm missing something \u200bdocs indicate it should work as it is. It is my intention that it's applied only on synchronous requests, so I didn't make it async compatible on purpose. If it's intentional in Django that every middleware needs to support async if the application is run as ASGI app, the documentation should probably state that clearly. Though it kinda defeats the purpose of having async_capable = False flag in the first place.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

It wraps synchronous methods with `sync_to_async` if `is_async` is True, and wraps asynchronous methods with `async_to_sync` if `is_async` is False.\n\nIn the context of middleware, `handler` is being adapted based on whether the middleware is asynchronous or not.\n\nThe issue seems to be that when `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the `handler` variable has already been adapted, and this adapted handler is passed to the next middleware, which might not expect it.\n\nI think the problem lies in the order of operations here. The handler is being adapted before the middleware is instantiated, and if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the adapted handler is still being used in the next iteration.\n\nMaybe the adaptation should happen after the middleware is instantiated, or the original handler should be preserved if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nPerhaps I can modify the code to store the original handler and only adapt it if the middleware is actually used.\n\nSomething like:\n\n- Start with the original handler\n\n- For each middleware:\n\n- Adapt the handler based on the middleware's async capabilities\n\n- Instantiate the middleware with the adapted handler\n\n- If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, revert to the original handler for the next middleware\n\nWait, but that might not be straightforward, because the adapted handler is meant to ensure that the middleware is called in the correct mode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can keep track of whether the middleware was actually used and only update the handler if it was.\n\nLet me look at the current code again.\n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\n```python\nfor middleware_path in settings.MIDDLEWARE:\n    ...\n    try:\n        # Adapt handler, if needed.\n        handler = self.adapt_method_mode(\n            middleware_is_async, handler, handler_is_async,\n            debug=settings.DEBUG, name='middleware %s' % middleware_path,\n        )\n        mw_instance = middleware(handler)\n    except MiddlewareNotUsed as exc:\n        if settings.DEBUG:\n            ...\n        continue\n    ...\n    handler = mw_instance\n```\n\nSo, the handler is adapted and then passed to the middleware constructor. If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, it continues to the next middleware, but the handler has already been adapted.\n\nPerhaps I can delay the adaptation until after the middleware is instantiated, or only apply the adaptation if the middleware is actually used.\n\nLet me try reordering the operations.\n\nSomething like:\n\n- For each middleware:\n\n- Try to instantiate the middleware with the original handler\n\n- If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, skip to the next middleware\n\n- If successful, adapt the handler based on the middleware's async capabilities\n\n- Update the handler to be the instantiated middleware\n\nWait, but in Django, middleware classes can modify the handler in their constructor, and the handler is passed to them so they can wrap it.\n\nI need to ensure that the handler is only adapted if the middleware is actually used.\n\nMaybe I can store the original handler before adapting and only set the handler to the instantiated middleware if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is not raised.\n\nLet me try to refactor this code.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\n```python\noriginal_handler = handler\nfor middleware_path in settings.MIDDLEWARE:\n    ...\n    try:\n        mw_instance = middleware(original_handler)\n    except MiddlewareNotUsed as exc:\n        if settings.DEBUG:\n            ...\n        continue\n    # Adapt handler only if middleware is used\n    handler = self.adapt_method_mode(\n        middleware_is_async, handler, handler_is_async,\n        debug=settings.DEBUG, name='middleware %s' % middleware_path,\n    )\n    handler = mw_instance\n```\n\nIn this version, I pass the original handler to the middleware constructor, and only adapt the handler if the middleware is actually used.\n\nThis way, if `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the handler remains unchanged, and the original handler is used for the next middleware.\n\nI need to verify if this approach maintains the intended behavior.\n\nLet me think about the implications.\n\n- If a middleware is marked as `async_capable`, it should adapt the handler to be asynchronous.\n\n- If a middleware is not `async_capable`, it should adapt the handler to be synchronous.\n\n- If `MiddlewareNotUsed` is raised, the handler should remain in its previous state.\n\nThis seems logical.\n\nI should also consider the order of the middleware. Middleware is applied in reverse order, so the first middleware in the list is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, in Django, middleware is applied in the order they are defined in `settings.MIDDLEWARE`, with the first-defined being the closest to the view.\n\nBut in the code, it seems like the handler is being wrapped in each middleware's `__call__` method.\n\nI need to make sure that the adaptation is done correctly at each step.\n\nMaybe I should look at the documentation or comments in the code to understand better.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_04", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py\", \"view_range\": [40, 70]}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py:\n    40\t            middleware = import_string(middleware_path)\n    41\t            middleware_can_sync = getattr(middleware, 'sync_capable', True)\n    42\t            middleware_can_async = getattr(middleware, 'async_capable', False)\n    43\t            if not middleware_can_sync and not middleware_can_async:\n    44\t                raise RuntimeError(\n    45\t                    'Middleware %s must have at least one of '\n    46\t                    'sync_capable/async_capable set to True.' % middleware_path\n    47\t                )\n    48\t            elif not handler_is_async and middleware_can_sync:\n    49\t                middleware_is_async = False\n    50\t            else:\n    51\t                middleware_is_async = middleware_can_async\n    52\t            try:\n    53\t                #
