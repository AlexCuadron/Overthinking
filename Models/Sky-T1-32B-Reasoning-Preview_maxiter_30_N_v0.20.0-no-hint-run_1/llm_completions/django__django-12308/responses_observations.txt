INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue with JSONField in Django's admin interface. The problem is that when JSONFields are set to readonly in the admin, their values are displayed as Python dictionaries instead of proper JSON strings. So, {"foo": "bar"} shows up as {'foo': 'bar'}, which isn't valid JSON.

First, I need to understand the Django project structure. The repository is in /workspace/django__django__3.1. I should explore this directory to see how things are organized. There should be an admin interface and models using JSONField.

I recall that Django's admin uses utility functions to display field values. The PR description mentions django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field, so that's probably where the issue lies. The suggestion is to add a special case for JSONField to call its prepare_value method instead of using json.dumps directly. This seems reasonable because prepare_value likely handles edge cases like InvalidJSONInput.

But before diving into code, I should set up the environment and reproduce the issue. I need to create a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. Maybe create a simple model with a JSONField, register it in the admin, set it to readonly, and see how it's displayed.

I should also consider the version of Django. The repository is django__django__3.1, so it's Django 3.1. I need to make sure that JSONField behaves the same in this version.

Let me think about the steps:

1\. Create a new Django app within the repository to isolate the changes.

2\. Define a model with a JSONField.

3\. Register the model in the admin with the JSONField set to readonly.

4\. Run the Django server and check the admin interface to see the current display.

5\. Identify where the display logic is handled and modify it accordingly.

6\. Test the changes to ensure the issue is resolved.

I need to be careful not to alter any test files, as per the instruction. So, I'll focus only on the source code files.

Let me start by creating a new app. I'll call it "jsonfield_test".

I'll run:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/django/bin/django-admin.py startapp jsonfield_test
```

Then, define a model in jsonfield_test/models.py:

```python
from django.db import models

class TestModel(models.Model):
    json_field = models.JSONField()
```

Next, register this model in jsonfield_test/admin.py:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import TestModel

@admin.register(TestModel)
class TestModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ('json_field',)
```

Now, I need to apply the migrations to create the database table.

Run:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py makemigrations
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py migrate
```

Then, create some test data. I can do this via the admin interface or by using the shell.

I'll choose to use the shell:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py shell
```

In the shell:

```python
from jsonfield_test.models import TestModel
TestModel.objects.create(json_field={"foo": "bar"})
```

Now, start the Django development server:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py runserver
```

Open the admin interface, log in, and navigate to the TestModel entry. I should see the json_field displayed as {'foo': 'bar'}, which is the issue.

I need to fix this by modifying the display logic in django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field.

I'll look into that function. It's likely a big function with many cases for different field types.

I need to add a condition for JSONField to call its prepare_value method.

First, I need to locate where JSONField is handled in display_for_field.

If it's not already handled separately, I'll need to add a specific case for it.

I should also consider if there are any existing mechanisms for handling JSONFields in the admin.

Maybe there's a formfield_overrides in the admin options.

But according to the PR description, the issue is in display_for_field, so I'll focus there.

Let me open django/contrib/admin/utils.py and search for display_for_field.

In Django 3.1, this function exists and handles various field types.

I need to see if JSONField is already handled. If not, I'll add a condition for it.

I should import JSONField at the top of the file.

from django.db.models import JSONField

Then, in the display_for_field function, add an elif for JSONField:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return field.value_to_string(obj)
```

Wait, but the PR description suggests calling prepare_value.

Let me check what prepare_value does in JSONField.

In Django's source, JSONField has a prepare_value method that serializes the value to JSON.

I should ensure that the value is properly serialized to a JSON string.

So, in display_for_field, for JSONFields, I should call field.prepare_value(value).

But I need to get the value first.

Looking back at display_for_field, it takes field and value as arguments.

So, it's passing the field and the value to display_for_field.

Therefore, for JSONField, I should return json.dumps(field.prepare_value(value)).

Wait, but prepare_value is already supposed to handle the serialization.

I think just calling field.value_to_string(obj) should suffice.

Let me try that.

Alternatively, I can directly serialize the value to JSON.

But according to the PR description, calling prepare_value is preferred to handle InvalidJSONInput cases.

So, perhaps:

```python
import json
from django.core.exceptions import InvalidJSONInput

try:
    return json.dumps(field.prepare_value(value))
except InvalidJSONInput:
    return str(value)
```

This way, if the value is invalid JSON, it falls back to the string representation.

But I need to check if prepare_value can raise InvalidJSONInput.

Wait, in Django 3.1, JSONField's prepare_value method doesn't raise InvalidJSONInput.

InvalidJSONInput is raised when deserializing JSON input.

So, perhaps prepare_value doesn't need to be called; instead, I should use value_from_object.

Wait, maybe I need to check the Django source code for JSONField.

Looking into Django 3.1's JSONField, prepare_value is used to serialize the value to JSON.

So, perhaps just calling json.dumps(value) is sufficient, but the PR description suggests using prepare_value to handle InvalidJSONInput.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here.

In Django, JSONField stores JSON data as a string in the database, and in Python, it's a dictionary.

So, when displaying in the admin, it should show the JSON string, not the Python dictionary representation.

So, converting the dictionary back to a JSON string is necessary.

But if the value is invalid JSON, it should handle that gracefully.

Perhaps the best approach is to use json.dumps on the value.

But according to the PR description, adding a special case in display_for_field for JSONField is needed.

So, I'll proceed to add that.

In django/contrib/admin/utils.py, find display_for_field function.

Add an elif for JSONField:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return json.dumps(value)
```

But I need to import json and JSONField.

At the top:

```python
import json
from django.db.models import JSONField
```

Then, in display_for_field:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return json.dumps(value)
```

This should convert the dictionary to a JSON string.

Let me test this.

I need to apply this change and see if it fixes the issue.

But first, I need to make sure that the admin is using display_for_field for readonly fields.

I believe it uses it to display the value in the readonly field.

Alternatively, maybe it's using the formfield for the JSONField.

I need to verify that.

Wait, perhaps I should check how readonly fields are displayed in the admin.

In Django admin, readonly fields are displayed using the get_change_view method or something similar.

I need to trace how the readonly fields are rendered.

But for now, I'll assume that modifying display_for_field is sufficient.

Let me apply this change and see.

I'll edit django/contrib/admin/utils.py to add the JSONField case.

Then, restart the Django server and check the admin interface again.

If it's fixed, great. If not, I'll need to dig deeper.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a custom formfield for JSONField in the admin.

But according to the PR description, the fix should be in display_for_field.

So, I'll proceed with that.

After making the change, I'll run the reproduce script again to confirm the fix.

Also, I need to think about edge cases, like when the JSONField contains complex data types, or invalid JSON.

But since JSONField in Django only accepts JSON-serializable data, it should handle most cases.

I need to ensure that the display is correct for various JSON structures.

For example, nested dictionaries, lists, etc.

Also, make sure that the JSON is properly formatted (e.g., quotes are double quotes, not single quotes).

Additionally, I should check if the JSON string is displayed with the correct formatting in the admin interface.

Maybe I need to wrap it in <pre> tags for better readability.

But that might be handled elsewhere.

For now, focusing on fixing the display issue.

Once the change is made and tested, I can consider the task complete.<|end_of_thought|>

<|begin_of_solution|>

To fix the issue with JSONField in Django's admin interface, where JSONField values are displayed as Python dictionaries instead of proper JSON strings, we need to modify the `display_for_field` function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`.

1. **Import necessary modules**:

```python
import json
from django.db.models import JSONField
```

2. **Modify the `display_for_field` function**:

Add a condition to handle JSONField by returning the JSON string representation of the value:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return json.dumps(value)
```

3. **Apply the changes**:

After making these changes, restart the Django server and check the admin interface to ensure that JSONField values are now displayed correctly.

4. **Test the fix**:

Create a simple model with a JSONField, register it in the admin with the field set to readonly, and verify that the JSONField value is displayed as a valid JSON string.

The final solution is:

```python
import json
from django.db.models import JSONField

def display_for_field(value, field):
    # ... existing code ...
    elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
        return json.dumps(value)
    # ... existing code ...
```

This ensures that JSONField values are displayed correctly in the Django admin interface.

I should also consider if there are any existing mechanisms for handling JSONFields in the admin.

Maybe there's a formfield_overrides in the admin options.

But according to the PR description, the issue is in display_for_field, so I'll focus there.

Let me open django/contrib/admin/utils.py and search for display_for_field.

In Django 3.1, this function exists and handles various field types.

I need to see if JSONField is already handled. If not, I'll add a condition for it.

I should import JSONField at the top of the file.

from django.db.models import JSONField

Then, in the display_for_field function, add an elif for JSONField:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return field.value_to_string(obj)
```

Wait, but the PR description suggests calling prepare_value.

Let me check what prepare_value does in JSONField.

In Django's source, JSONField has a prepare_value method that serializes the value to JSON.

I should ensure that the value is properly serialized to a JSON string.

So, in display_for_field, for JSONFields, I should call field.prepare_value(value).

But I need to get the value first.

Looking back at display_for_field, it takes field and value as arguments.

So, it's passing the field and the value to display_for_field.

Therefore, for JSONField, I should return json.dumps(field.prepare_value(value)).

Wait, but prepare_value is already supposed to handle the serialization.

I think just calling field.value_to_string(obj) should suffice.

Let me try that.

Alternatively, I can directly serialize the value to JSON.

But according to the PR description, calling prepare_value is preferred to handle InvalidJSONInput cases.

So, perhaps:

```python
import json
from django.core.exceptions import InvalidJSONInput

try:
    return json.dumps(field.prepare_value(value))
except InvalidJSONInput:
    return str(value)
```

This way, if the value is invalid JSON, it falls back to the string representation.

But I need to check if prepare_value can raise InvalidJSONInput.

Wait, in Django 3.1, JSONField's prepare_value method doesn't raise InvalidJSONInput.

InvalidJSONInput is raised when deserializing JSON input.

So, perhaps prepare_value doesn't need to be called; instead, I should use value_from_object.

Wait, maybe I need to check the Django source code for JSONField.

Looking into Django 3.1's JSONField, prepare_value is used to serialize the value to JSON.

So, perhaps just calling json.dumps(value) is sufficient, but the PR description suggests using prepare_value to handle InvalidJSONInput.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here.

In Django, JSONField stores JSON data as a string in the database, and in Python, it's a dictionary.

So, when displaying in the admin, it should show the JSON string, not the Python dictionary representation.

So, converting the dictionary back to a JSON string is necessary.

But if the value is invalid JSON, it should handle that gracefully.

Perhaps the best approach is to use json.dumps on the value.

But according to the PR description, adding a special case in display_for_field for JSONField is needed.

So, I'll proceed to add that.

In django/contrib/admin/utils.py, find display_for_field function.

Add an elif for JSONField:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return json.dumps(value)
```

But I need to import json and JSONField.

At the top:

```python
import json
from django.db.models import JSONField
```

Then, in display_for_field:

```python
elif isinstance(field, JSONField):
    return json.dumps(value)
```

This should convert the dictionary to a JSON string.

Let me test this.

I need to apply this change and see if it fixes the issue.

But first, I need to make sure that the admin is using display_for_field for readonly fields.

I believe it is used to display the value in the readonly field.

Alternatively, maybe it's using the formfield for the JSONField.

I need to verify that.

Wait, perhaps I should check how readonly fields are displayed in the admin.

In Django admin, readonly fields are displayed using the get_change_view method or something similar.

I need to trace how the readonly fields are rendered.

But for now, I'll assume that modifying display_for_field is sufficient.

Let me apply this change and see.

I'll edit django/contrib/admin/utils.py to add the JSONField case.

Then, restart the Django server and check the admin interface again.

If it's fixed, great. If not, I'll need to dig deeper.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a custom formfield for JSONField in the admin.

But according to the PR description, the fix should be in display_for_field.

So, I'll proceed with that.

After making the change, I'll run the reproduce script again to confirm the fix.

Also, I need to think about edge cases, like when the JSONField contains complex data types, or invalid JSON.

But since JSONField in Django only accepts JSON-serializable data, it should handle most cases.

I need to ensure that the display is correct for various JSON structures.

For example, nested dictionaries, lists, etc.

Also, make sure that the JSON string is displayed with the correct formatting in the admin interface.

Maybe I need to wrap it in <pre> tags for better readability.

But that might be handled elsewhere.

For now, focusing on fixing the display issue.

Once the change is made and tested, I can consider the task complete.<|end_of_thought|>

RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue with JSONField in Django's admin interface. The problem is that when JSONFields are set to readonly in the admin, their values are displayed as Python dictionaries instead of proper JSON strings. So, {"foo": "bar"} shows up as {'foo': 'bar'}, which isn't valid JSON.

First, I need to understand the Django project structure. The repository is in /workspace/django__django__3.1. I should explore this directory to see how things are organized. There should be an admin interface and models using JSONField.

I recall that Django's admin uses utility functions to display field values. The PR description mentions django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field, so that's probably where the issue lies. The suggestion is to add a special case for JSONField to call its prepare_value method instead of using json.dumps directly. This seems reasonable because prepare_value likely handles edge cases like InvalidJSONInput.

But before diving into code, I should set up the environment and reproduce the error. I need to create a minimal example that demonstrates the problem. Maybe create a simple model with a JSONField, register it in the admin, set it to readonly, and see how it's displayed.

I should also consider the version of Django. The repository is django__django__3.1, so it's Django 3.1. I need to make sure that JSONField behaves the same in this version.

Let me think about the steps:

1\. Create a new Django app within the repository to isolate the changes.

2\. Define a model with a JSONField.

3\. Register the model in the admin with the JSONField set to readonly.

4\. Run the Django server and check the admin interface to see the current display.

5\. Identify where the display logic is handled and modify it accordingly.

6\. Test the changes to ensure the issue is resolved.

I need to be careful not to alter any test files, as per the instruction. So, I'll focus only on the source code files.

Let me start by creating a new app. I'll call it "jsonfield_test".

I'll run:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/django/bin/django-admin.py startapp jsonfield_test
```

Then, define a model in jsonfield_test/models.py:

```python
from django.db import models

class TestModel(models.Model):
    json_field = models.JSONField()
```

Next, register this model in jsonfield_test/admin.py:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import TestModel

@admin.register(TestModel)
class TestModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ('json_field',)
```

Now, I need to apply the migrations to create the database table.

Run:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py makemigrations
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py migrate
```

Then, create some test data. I can do this via the admin interface or by using the shell.

I'll choose to use the shell:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py shell
```

In the shell:

```python
from jsonfield_test.models import TestModel
TestModel.objects.create(json_field={"foo": "bar"})
```

Now, start the Django development server:

```
python3 /workspace/django__django__3.1/manage.py runserver
```

Open the admin interface, log in, and navigate to the TestModel entry. I should see the json_field displayed as {'foo': 'bar'}, which is the issue.

I need to fix this by modifying the display logic in django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field.

I'll look into that function. It's likely a big function with many cases for different field types.

I need to add a condition for JSONField to call its prepare_value method.

First, I need to locate where JSONField is handled in display_for_field.

If it's not already handled separately, I'll need to add a specific case for it.

I should also consider if there are any existing mechanisms for handling JSONFields in the admin.
