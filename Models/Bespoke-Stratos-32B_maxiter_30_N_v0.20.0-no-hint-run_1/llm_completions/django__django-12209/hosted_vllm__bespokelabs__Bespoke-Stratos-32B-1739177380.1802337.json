By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is about a change in behavior when saving a model instance with an explicit primary key (pk) value in Django 3.0 compared to earlier versions like 2.2. The model in question has a UUIDField as the primary key with a default value of uuid4. \n\nFrom the description, in Django 2.2, when you create an instance, then create another instance with the same pk and save it, it results in an INSERT followed by an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it tries to do two INSERTs, which fails because the pk is already present. The issue seems related to a ticket on Django's tracker.\n\nThe goal is to make the behavior in Django 3.0 match the previous versions, so that when you save an instance with an explicit pk, it updates the existing record instead of trying to insert a new one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why this change happened. The ticket mentioned (29260) probably explains the reasoning behind the change. Let me check the ticket's description. \n\nLooking at the ticket, it's about the behavior of the save() method when the pk is set. The change in Django 3.0 might have been to make the save() method more strict about the pk, ensuring that if the pk is set, it's treated as an existing instance and thus should be updated, but perhaps there's a case where the existing instance isn't found, leading to an INSERT instead of an UPDATE.\n\nWait, but according to the issue description, in Django 3.0, the second save() tries to insert a new record, which fails because the pk already exists. So, the problem is that Django 3.0 is not checking if the instance with the given pk already exists before trying to insert. \n\nSo, the fix would involve modifying Django's save() method to check if the instance with the given pk exists before deciding whether to perform an INSERT or UPDATE. \n\nBut where exactly in the Django codebase is the save() method implemented? It's likely in the models module, perhaps in the Model class. Let me look for the save() method in the Django source code.\n\nThe repository is in /workspace/django__django__3.1.
