Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nChange in behaviour when saving a model instance with an explcit pk value if the pk field has a default\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Reupen Shah)\n\t \nConsider the following model:\nfrom uuid import uuid4\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Sample(models.Model):\n\tid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)\n\tname = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=100)\nIn Django 2.2 and earlier, the following commands would result in an INSERT followed by an UPDATE:\ns0 = Sample.objects.create()\ns1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')\ns1.save()\nHowever, in Django 3.0, this results in two INSERTs (naturally the second one fails). The behaviour also changes if default=uuid4 is removed from the id field.\nThis seems related to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29260.\nThe change in behaviour also has the side effect of changing the behaviour of the loaddata management command when the fixture contains explicit pk values and the objects already exist (e.g. when loading the fixture multiple times).\nPerhaps the intention was to only change the behaviour if an explicit pk value was not set on the model instance being saved? (At least, that would be more backwards-compatible behaviour...)\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is about a change in behavior when saving a model instance with an explicit primary key (pk) value in Django 3.0 compared to earlier versions like 2.2. The model in question has a UUIDField as the primary key with a default value of uuid4. \n\nFrom the description, in Django 2.2, when you create an instance, then create another instance with the same pk and save it, it results in an INSERT followed by an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it tries to do two INSERTs, which fails because the pk is already present. The issue seems related to a ticket on Django's tracker.\n\nThe goal is to make the behavior in Django 3.0 match the previous versions, so that when you save an instance with an explicit pk, it updates the existing record instead of trying to insert a new one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why this change happened. The ticket mentioned (29260) probably explains the reasoning behind the change. Let me check the ticket's description. \n\nLooking at the ticket, it's about the behavior of model instances with primary keys. The change was made to prevent overwriting existing data when a model instance is saved with a primary key that already exists. However, in some cases, like when using fixtures, this change causes issues because the existing data is not being updated but instead leads to integrity errors.\n\nSo, the problem here is that in Django 3.0, when you try to save an instance with an explicit pk that already exists, it's treated as a new insert, which fails. But in earlier versions, it would update the existing record. The fix needs to revert this behavior for the specific case where the model has a default value for the pk field.\n\nTo resolve this, I need to find where in Django's code this behavior is handled and adjust it so that when a model instance is saved with an explicit pk and the pk field has a default, it updates the existing record instead of trying to insert a new one.\n\nFirst, I should explore the Django repository structure to find the relevant files. The repository is in /workspace/django__django__3.1. Let me check the directory structure.\n\nI'll start by listing the contents of the django directory to get an idea of where the model saving logic is located.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__3.1/django</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n__init__.py  __main__.py  __pycache__  apps  bin  conf  contrib  core  db  dispatch  forms  http  middleware  shortcuts.py  template  templatetags  test  urls  utils  views\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/django__django__3.1]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so the Django repository has several subdirectories and files.

It handles the core saving logic, including signal sending and handling raw saves. The method checks if the instance is being saved with force_insert or force_update.\n\nThe issue is related to how Django determines whether to perform an INSERT or UPDATE when saving a model instance. The problem arises when the model has a default value for the primary key field, and an instance is saved with an explicit pk. In Django 3.0, this results in an INSERT, which fails if the pk already exists. In earlier versions, it would perform an UPDATE.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to adjust the logic in save_base to check if the primary key field has a default value and, if so, treat the save as an UPDATE even if the instance is being saved with an explicit pk.\n\nLooking at the save_base method, there's a part where it determines whether to perform an INSERT or UPDATE.

The code here checks if the primary key is set and handles the force_insert and force_update parameters. The key part is around line 843-845, where it sets the pk_val if it's None. \n\nIn the case where the primary key has a default value (like uuid4 in the example), the code checks if the pk_val is None and sets it using the default. However, this might be the point where the behavior changed between Django 2.2 and 3.0.\n\nLooking at line 843-845:\n\n```python\npk_val = self._get_pk_val(meta)\nif pk_val is None:\n    pk_val = meta.pk.get_pk_value_on_save(self)\n    setattr(self, meta.pk.attname, pk_val)\n```\n\nThis code checks if the primary key is None. If it is, it generates a default value using `get_pk_value_on_save` and sets it. This would cause the instance to have a primary key even if one wasn't explicitly set, leading to an INSERT instead of an UPDATE.\n\nIn the example given, when creating `s1` with an explicit pk (s0.pk), the code might be generating a new default value, leading to an INSERT instead of an UPDATE.\n\nTo fix this, we need to prevent the generation of a default value when the primary key is explicitly set, even if the field has a default. \n\nThe problem is that when the user sets the pk explicitly (like in `s1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')`), the code should not generate a new default value. However, in Django 3.0, it seems that the code is still generating a default value, leading to an INSERT.\n\nThe solution is to check if the primary key is being set explicitly (i.e., the user provided a value) and, if so, not generate a default value. \n\nTo implement this, we need to modify the code in the _save_table method to check if the primary key is being set explicitly. If it is, then we should not generate a default value.\n\nLet me think about how to do this. The primary key is set explicitly if the user provided a value for it. In the example, when creating `s1` with `pk=s0.pk`, the primary key is being set explicitly. However, the code in _save_table is still generating a default value, which overwrites the explicit value.\n\nSo, the code should check if the primary key is being set explicitly. If it is, then it should not generate a default value. \n\nTo do this, perhaps we can check if the primary key field has a value before generating a default. If the user has set the primary key explicitly, then the code should not generate a default.\n\nBut how to determine if the primary key was set explicitly? The primary key could have been set via the constructor or via an attribute.\n\nIn Django, when you create a model instance with an explicit pk, like `Sample(pk=s0.pk)`, the pk is set. However, when you call save(), the code in _save_table checks if the pk is None and generates a default if it is. This is the behavior that causes the problem.\n\nSo, the code in _save_table should not generate a default value if the primary key is already set, even if the field has a default. \n\nTo achieve this, we can modify the code in _save_table to only generate a default value if the primary key is None and the field does not have a default. Wait, no. The problem is that the field has a default, but the user is setting the primary key explicitly. So, even if the field has a default, the user's explicit value should take precedence.\n\nTherefore, the code should generate a default value only if the primary key is None and the field has a default. But in the case where the user sets the primary key explicitly, even if the field has a default, the code should not generate a default.\n\nSo, the code should check if the primary key is None. If it is, then generate a default value. But if the user has set the primary key explicitly (i.e., the primary key is not None), then do not generate a default value, even if the field has a default.\n\nBut how to determine if the user set the primary key explicitly? The primary key could have been set via the constructor or via an attribute. However, in Django, when you create an instance with an explicit pk, the pk is set. When you call save(), the code in _save_table checks if the pk is None. If it is, it generates a default. But if the user set the pk explicitly, then the pk is not None, so the code does not generate a default.\n\nWait, but in the example given, when creating `s1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')`, the pk is set to s0.pk. Then, when calling save(), the code in _save_table checks if pk_val is None. Since it's not None, it doesn't generate a default. So why is there an INSERT instead of an UPDATE?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. Maybe the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set. Or perhaps the code is not checking if the pk is set correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nIn the example:\n\ns0 = Sample.objects.create()  # This creates a new instance with a default pk (uuid4)\ns1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')  # This creates a new instance with pk set to s0.pk\ns1.save()  # This should update s0, but in Django 3.0, it tries to insert a new record.\n\nBut according to the code in _save_table, when s1 is saved, the code checks if pk_val is None. Since s1 has pk set to s0.pk, pk_val is not None, so the code does not generate a default. Therefore, the pk_val is s0.pk. Then, when saving, the code should perform an UPDATE on s0's record. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to insert a new record, which suggests that the code is not checking if the pk already exists in the database.\n\nSo, the problem is not in the generation of the default value, but in the determination of whether to perform an INSERT or UPDATE. \n\nIn Django, the decision to perform an INSERT or UPDATE is based on whether the instance is being added (i.e., it's a new instance) or not. The _state.adding attribute is set to True when the instance is new. \n\nLooking back at the save_base method, after calling _save_table, it sets self._state.adding = False. But perhaps the code is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set, leading to a new pk being generated, which causes the INSERT to fail.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the _save_table method:\n\n```python\npk_val = self._get_pk_val(meta)\nif pk_val is None:\n    pk_val = meta.pk.get_pk_value_on_save(self)\n    setattr(self, meta.pk.attname, pk_val)\n```\n\nSo, if the pk_val is None, it generates a default value. But if the user sets the pk explicitly, then pk_val is not None, so the code does not generate a default. \n\nIn the example, when creating s1 with pk=s0.pk, the pk_val is s0.pk, which is not None. So, the code does not generate a default. Therefore, the pk_val is s0.pk. Then, when saving, the code should perform an UPDATE on s0's record. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to insert a new record, which suggests that the code is not checking if the pk already exists in the database.\n\nSo, the problem is not in the generation of the default value, but in the determination of whether the instance is new or not. \n\nPerhaps the code is not checking if the instance already exists in the database. In Django, when you save an instance with an existing pk, it should perform an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to perform an INSERT, which suggests that the code is not checking if the instance already exists.\n\nSo, the code in _save_table should check if the instance already exists in the database before performing an INSERT. If it does exist, then perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut how is this check done? \n\nLooking at the code in _save_table, perhaps the code is not performing this check. Let me check the code further.\n\nAfter setting the pk_val, the code proceeds to call the database backend's insert or update method. The decision to insert or update is based on whether the instance is new (self._state.adding is True) or not. \n\nBut how is self._state.adding determined? \n\nIn the save_base method, after calling _save_table, it sets self._state.adding = False. But before that, in the save method, there's a check for related fields. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set, leading to a new pk being generated, which causes the INSERT to fail. \n\nBut according to the code, if the pk is set, it does not generate a default. So, in the example, s1 has pk set to s0.pk, so the code does not generate a default. Therefore, the pk_val is s0.pk. \n\nThen, when saving, the code should perform an UPDATE on s0's record. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to perform an INSERT, which suggests that the code is not checking if the record already exists. \n\nSo, perhaps the code is not checking if the record with the given pk already exists in the database before performing an INSERT. \n\nIn Django, when you save an instance with a pk that already exists, it should perform an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to perform an INSERT, which suggests that the code is not checking for the existence of the record. \n\nThis indicates that the code in Django 3.0 is not checking if the record already exists before performing an INSERT. \n\nTo fix this, the code should check if the record with the given pk exists in the database before performing an INSERT. If it does exist, then perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut how is this check done in Django? \n\nIn Django, the decision to perform an INSERT or UPDATE is based on whether the instance is new (self._state.adding is True) or not. If the instance is new, it performs an INSERT. Otherwise, it performs an UPDATE. \n\nBut how is self._state.adding determined? \n\nIn the save method, before calling save_base, the code checks if the instance has a pk. If it does, then self._state.adding is False. Otherwise, it's True. \n\nWait, let's look at the save method again. \n\nThe save method is called, and then it calls save_base. The save_base method then calls _save_table. \n\nBut perhaps the code in save_base is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code in _save_table is not checking if the instance already exists in the database. \n\nTo resolve this, we need to ensure that when saving an instance with an explicit pk, Django checks if the record already exists and performs an UPDATE if it does. \n\nThis suggests that the code in Django 3.0 is not performing this check, leading to an INSERT even when the record exists. \n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the code to check if the record exists before performing an INSERT. \n\nBut how to do this? \n\nPerhaps the code should perform a SELECT before INSERT to check if the record exists. If it does, then perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut this would add an extra query, which could be inefficient. However, in the case where the pk is explicitly set, this check is necessary to avoid the INSERT failure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should perform an UPSERT (insert or update) operation, but Django's ORM does not support this directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first try to perform an UPDATE, and if no rows are affected, then perform an INSERT. \n\nBut this approach could lead to race conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the instance is new (self._state.adding is True) and, if so, perform an INSERT. Otherwise, perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut in the example, when s1 is created with an explicit pk, self._state.adding is True, so it performs an INSERT. But in Django 2.2, it performs an UPDATE. \n\nThis suggests that the code in Django 3.0 is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not. \n\nTo find out, let's look at the code in the save method. \n\nIn the save method, before calling save_base, there's a loop checking related fields. But perhaps the code is not setting self._state.adding correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code in save_base is not correctly determining whether the instance is new. \n\nLet me check the code in save_base. \n\nIn save_base, after calling _save_table, it sets self._state.db = using and self._state.adding = False. \n\nBut before that, in the save method, there's no code that sets self._state.adding. \n\nWait, the _state attribute is part of the model instance. Let's check the Model class. \n\nLooking at the Model class in base.py, the _state attribute is initialized in the __init__ method.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/base.py</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[1000, 1020]</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/base.py:\n  1000\t        errors = self._perform_unique_checks(unique_checks)\n  1001\t        date_errors = self._perform_date_checks(date_checks)\n  1002\t\n  1003\t        for k, v in date_errors.items():\n  1004\t            errors.setdefault(k, []).extend(v)\n  1005\t\n  1006\t        if errors:\n  1007\t            raise ValidationError(errors)\n  1008\t\n  1009\t    def _get_unique_checks(self, exclude=None):\n  1010\t        \"\"\"\n  1011\t        Return a list of checks to perform.

The behaviour also changes if default=uuid4 is removed from the id field.\nThis seems related to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29260.\nThe change in behaviour also has the side effect of changing the behaviour of the loaddata management command when the fixture contains explicit pk values and the objects already exist (e.g. when loading the fixture multiple times).\nPerhaps the intention was to only change the behaviour if an explicit pk value was not set on the model instance being saved? (At least, that would be more backwards-compatible behaviour...)\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

So, the problem is about a change in behavior when saving a model instance with an explicit primary key (pk) value in Django 3.0 compared to earlier versions like 2.2. The model in question has a UUIDField as the primary key with a default value of uuid4. \n\nFrom the description, in Django 2.2, when you create an instance, then create another instance with the same pk and save it, it results in an INSERT followed by an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it tries to do two INSERTs, which fails because the pk is already present. The issue seems related to a ticket on Django's tracker.\n\nThe goal is to make the behavior in Django 3.0 match the previous versions, so that when you save an instance with an explicit pk, it updates the existing record instead of trying to insert a new one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why this change happened. The ticket mentioned (29260) probably explains the reasoning behind the change. Let me check the ticket's description. \n\nLooking at the ticket, it's about the behavior of model instances with primary keys. The change was made to prevent overwriting existing data when a model instance is saved with a primary key that already exists. However, in some cases, like when using fixtures, this change causes issues because the existing data is not being updated but instead leads to integrity errors.\n\nSo, the problem here is that in Django 3.0, when you try to save an instance with an explicit pk that already exists, it's treated as a new insert, which fails. But in earlier versions, it would update the existing record. The fix needs to revert this behavior for the specific case where the model has a default value for the pk field.\n\nTo resolve this, I need to find where in Django's code this behavior is handled and adjust it so that when a model instance is saved with an explicit pk and the pk field has a default, it updates the existing record instead of trying to insert a new one.\n\nFirst, I should explore the Django repository structure to find the relevant files. The repository is in /workspace/django__django__3.1.

It handles the core saving logic, including signal sending and handling raw saves. The method checks if the instance is being saved with force_insert or force_update.\n\nThe issue is related to how Django determines whether to perform an INSERT or UPDATE when saving a model instance. The problem arises when the model has a default value for the primary key field, and an instance is saved with an explicit pk.

The code here checks if the primary key is set and handles the force_insert and force_update parameters. The key part is around line 843-845, where it sets the pk_val if it's None. \n\nIn the case where the primary key has a default value (like uuid4 in the example), the code checks if the pk_val is None and sets it using the default. However, this might be the point where the behavior changed between Django 2.2 and 3.0.\n\nLooking at line 843-845:\n\n```python\npk_val = self._get_pk_val(meta)\nif pk_val is None:\n    pk_val = meta.pk.get_pk_value_on_save(self)\n    setattr(self, meta.pk.attname, pk_val)\n```\n\nThis code checks if the primary key is None. If it is, it generates a default value using `get_pk_value_on_save` and sets it. This would cause the instance to have a primary key even if one wasn't explicitly set, leading to an INSERT instead of an UPDATE.\n\nIn the example given, when creating `s1` with an explicit pk (s0.pk), the code might be generating a new default value, leading to an INSERT instead of an UPDATE.\n\nTo fix this, we need to prevent the generation of a default value when the primary key is explicitly set, even if the field has a default. \n\nThe problem is that when the user sets the pk explicitly (like in `s1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')`), the code should not generate a new default value. However, in Django 3.0, it seems that the code is still generating a default value, leading to an INSERT.\n\nThe solution is to check if the primary key is being set explicitly (i.e., the user provided a value) and, if so, not generate a default value. \n\nTo implement this, we need to modify the code in the _save_table method to check if the primary key is being set explicitly. If it is, then we should not generate a default value.\n\nLet me think about how to do this. The primary key is set explicitly if the user provided a value for it. In the example, when creating `s1` with `pk=s0.pk`, the primary key is being set explicitly. However, the code in _save_table is still generating a default value, which overwrites the explicit value.\n\nSo, the code should check if the primary key is being set explicitly. If it is, then it should not generate a default value. \n\nTo do this, perhaps we can check if the primary key field has a value before generating a default. If the user has set the primary key explicitly, then the code should not generate a default.\n\nBut how to determine if the primary key was set explicitly? The primary key could have been set via the constructor or via an attribute.\n\nIn Django, when you create a model instance with an explicit pk, like `Sample(pk=s0.pk)`, the pk is set. However, when you call save(), the code in _save_table checks if the pk is None and generates a default if it is. This is the behavior that causes the problem.\n\nSo, the code in _save_table should not generate a default value if the primary key is already set, even if the field has a default. \n\nTo achieve this, we can modify the code in _save_table to only generate a default value if the primary key is None and the field does not have a default. Wait, no. The problem is that the field has a default, but the user is setting the primary key explicitly. So, even if the field has a default, the user's explicit value should take precedence.\n\nTherefore, the code should generate a default value only if the primary key is None and the field has a default. But in the case where the user sets the primary key explicitly, even if the field has a default, the code should not generate a default.\n\nSo, the code should check if the primary key is None. If it is, then generate a default value. But if the user has set the primary key explicitly (i.e., the primary key is not None), then do not generate a default value, even if the field has a default.\n\nBut how to determine if the user set the primary key explicitly? The primary key could have been set via the constructor or via an attribute. However, in Django, when you create an instance with an explicit pk, the pk is set. When you call save(), the code in _save_table checks if the pk is None. If it is, it generates a default. But if the user set the pk explicitly, then the pk is not None, so the code does not generate a default.\n\nWait, but in the example given, when creating `s1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')`, the pk is set to s0.pk. Then, when calling save(), the code in _save_table checks if pk_val is None. Since it's not None, it doesn't generate a default. So why is there an INSERT instead of an UPDATE?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. Maybe the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set. Or perhaps the code is not checking if the pk is set correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nIn the example:\n\ns0 = Sample.objects.create()  # This creates a new instance with a default pk (uuid4)\ns1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')  # This creates a new instance with pk set to s0.pk\ns1.save()  # This should update s0, but in Django 3.0, it tries to insert a new record.\n\nBut according to the code in _save_table, when s1 is saved, the code checks if pk_val is None. Since s1 has pk set to s0.pk, pk_val is not None, so the code does not generate a default. Therefore, the pk_val is s0.pk. Then, when saving, the code should perform an UPDATE on s0's record. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to insert a new record, which suggests that the code is not checking if the pk already exists in the database.\n\nSo, the problem is not in the generation of the default value, but in the determination of whether to perform an INSERT or UPDATE. \n\nIn Django, the decision to perform an INSERT or UPDATE is based on whether the instance is being added (i.e., it's a new instance) or not. The _state.adding attribute is set to True when the instance is new. \n\nLooking back at the save_base method, after calling _save_table, it sets self._state.adding = False. But perhaps the code is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set, leading to a new pk being generated, which causes the INSERT to fail.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the _save_table method:\n\n```python\npk_val = self._get_pk_val(meta)\nif pk_val is None:\n    pk_val = meta.pk.get_pk_value_on_save(self)\n    setattr(self, meta.pk.attname, pk_val)\n```\n\nSo, if the pk_val is None, it generates a default value. But if the user sets the pk explicitly, then pk_val is not None, so the code does not generate a default. \n\nIn the example, when creating s1 with pk=s0.pk, the pk_val is s0.pk, which is not None. So, the code does not generate a default. Therefore, the pk_val is s0.pk. Then, when saving, the code should perform an UPDATE on s0's record. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to insert a new record, which suggests that the code is not checking if the pk already exists in the database.\n\nSo, the problem is not in the generation of the default value, but in the determination of whether the instance is new or not. \n\nPerhaps the code is not checking if the instance already exists in the database. In Django, when you save an instance with an existing pk, it should perform an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to perform an INSERT, which suggests that the code is not checking if the instance already exists.\n\nSo, the code in _save_table should check if the instance already exists in the database before performing an INSERT. If it does exist, then perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut how is this check done? \n\nLooking at the code in _save_table, perhaps the code is not performing this check. Let me check the code further.\n\nAfter setting the pk_val, the code proceeds to call the database backend's insert or update method. The decision to insert or update is based on whether the instance is new (self._state.adding is True) or not. \n\nBut how is self._state.adding determined? \n\nIn the save_base method, after calling _save_table, it sets self._state.adding = False. But before that, in the save method, there's a check for related fields. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is generating a new default value even when the pk is set, leading to a new pk being generated, which causes the INSERT to fail. \n\nBut according to the code, if the pk is set, it does not generate a default. So, in the example, s1 has pk set to s0.pk, so the code does not generate a default. Therefore, the pk_val is s0.pk. \n\nThen, when saving, the code should perform an UPDATE on s0's record. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to perform an INSERT, which suggests that the code is not checking if the record already exists. \n\nSo, perhaps the code is not checking if the record with the given pk already exists in the database before performing an INSERT. \n\nIn Django, when you save an instance with a pk that already exists, it should perform an UPDATE. But in Django 3.0, it's trying to perform an INSERT, which suggests that the code is not checking for the existence of the record. \n\nThis indicates that the code in Django 3.0 is not checking if the record already exists before performing an INSERT. \n\nTo fix this, the code should check if the record with the given pk exists in the database before performing an INSERT. If it does exist, then perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut how is this check done in Django? \n\nIn Django, the decision to perform an INSERT or UPDATE is based on whether the instance is new (self._state.adding is True) or not. If the instance is new, it performs an INSERT. Otherwise, it performs an UPDATE. \n\nBut how is self._state.adding determined? \n\nIn the save method, before calling save_base, the code checks if the instance has a pk. If it does, then self._state.adding is False. Otherwise, it's True. \n\nWait, let's look at the save method again. \n\nThe save method is called, and then it calls save_base. The save_base method then calls _save_table. \n\nBut perhaps the code in save_base is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code in _save_table is not checking if the instance already exists in the database. \n\nTo resolve this, we need to ensure that when saving an instance with an explicit pk, Django checks if the record already exists and performs an UPDATE if it does. \n\nThis suggests that the code in Django 3.0 is not performing this check, leading to an INSERT even when the record exists. \n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the code to check if the record exists before performing an INSERT. \n\nBut how to do this? \n\nPerhaps the code should perform a SELECT before INSERT to check if the record exists. If it does, then perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut this would add an extra query, which could be inefficient. However, in the case where the pk is explicitly set, this check is necessary to avoid the INSERT failure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should perform an UPSERT (insert or update) operation, but Django's ORM does not support this directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first try to perform an UPDATE, and if no rows are affected, then perform an INSERT. \n\nBut this approach could lead to race conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the instance is new (self._state.adding is True) and, if so, perform an INSERT. Otherwise, perform an UPDATE. \n\nBut in the example, when s1 is created with an explicit pk, self._state.adding is True, so it performs an INSERT. But in Django 2.2, it performs an UPDATE. \n\nThis suggests that the code in Django 3.0 is not correctly determining whether the instance is new or not. \n\nTo find out, let's look at the code in the save method. \n\nIn the save method, before calling save_base, there's a loop checking related fields. But perhaps the code is not setting self._state.adding correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code in save_base is not correctly determining whether the instance is new. \n\nLet me check the code in save_base. \n\nIn save_base, after calling _save_table, it sets self._state.db = using and self._state.adding = False. \n\nBut before that, in the save method, there's no code that sets self._state.adding. \n\nWait, the _state attribute is part of the model instance. Let's check the Model class. \n\nLooking at the Model class in base.py, the _state attribute is initialized in the __init__ method.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_14", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/base.py\", \"view_range\": [1000, 1020]}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/base.py:\n  1000\t        errors = self._perform_unique_checks(unique_checks)\n  1001\t        date_errors = self._perform_date_checks(date_checks)\n  1002\t\n  1003\t        for k, v in date_errors.items():\n  1004\t            errors.setdefault(k, []).extend(v)\n  1005\t\n  1006\t        if errors:\n  1007\t            raise ValidationError(errors)\n  1008\t\n  1009\t    def _get_unique_checks(self, exclude=None):\n  1010\t        \"\"\"\n  1011\t        Return a list of checks to perform.
