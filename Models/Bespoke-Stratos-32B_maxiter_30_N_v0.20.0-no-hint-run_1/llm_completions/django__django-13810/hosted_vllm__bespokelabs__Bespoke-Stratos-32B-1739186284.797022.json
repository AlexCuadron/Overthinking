Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nMiddlewareNotUsed leaves undesired side effects when loading middleware in ASGI context\nDescription\n\t\nI experienced strange issues when working with \u200bASGI , \u200bdjango-debug-toolbar and my own small middleware. It was hard problem to debug, I uploaded an example project here: \u200bhttps://github.com/hbielenia/asgi-djangotoolbar-bug (the name is misleading - I initially thought it's a bug with django-debug-toolbar).\nThe SESSION_FILE_PATH setting is intentionally broken to cause a 500 error. When starting the application and accessing /admin (any location really, but I wanted to leave it at a minimum and didn't add any views) it gives TypeError: object HttpResponse can't be used in 'await' expression. Commenting out asgi_djangotoolbar_bug.middleware.DummyMiddleware fixes the issue (in that I receive a 500 ImproperlyConfigured exception). I'm not sure about the overall role of django-debug-toolbar here - removing it causes Daphne to return a 500 error page but without debug information and there's no traceback in console either. I decided to leave it since it helped me approximate the causes of issue.\nI notice that in \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/3.1.4/django/core/handlers/base.py#L58 while MiddlewareNotUsed causes the loop to skip futher processing and go to next middleware, it does leave handler variable overwritten with output of self.adapt_method_mode(). On next pass, this handler is passed to next middleware instance, disregarding all the previous checks for (lack of) async support. This likely causes the middleware chain to be \"poisoned\" from this point onwards, resulting in last middleware in response cycle to return an HttpResponse as a synchronous middleware would, instead of coroutine that is expected.\nThis is probably avoided by adding async support to my middleware, but unless I'm missing something \u200bdocs indicate it should work as it is. It is my intention that it's applied only on synchronous requests, so I didn't make it async compatible on purpose. If it's intentional in Django that every middleware needs to support async if the application is run as ASGI app, the documentation should probably state that clearly. Though it kinda defeats the purpose of having async_capable = False flag in the first place.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is related to Django's middleware when running in an ASGI context. The user is experiencing a TypeError because an HttpResponse object is being used in an 'await' expression, which suggests that somewhere in the middleware chain, a synchronous response is being treated as an asynchronous one. The issue seems to stem from the MiddlewareNotUsed exception not properly handling the middleware chain when some middlewares are synchronous and others are asynchronous.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository. The uploaded directory is django__django__3.2, which is likely the Django 3.2 codebase. The issue description mentions that the problem occurs in the base.py file of the core handlers. Specifically, in Django 3.1.4, there's a line where MiddlewareNotUsed is handled, but the handler variable is overwritten with the result of self.adapt_method_mode(), which might be causing issues when the middleware chain is processed.\n\nThe user's example project uses Django Debug Toolbar and a custom middleware. When the custom middleware is included, it causes a TypeError, but commenting it out leads to a different error. The core of the problem seems to be that when a middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler is still being passed through the remaining middleware, which might not handle it correctly in an ASGI context.\n\nSo, the plan is to look into the Django core handlers, specifically the base.py file, and see how the middleware is being processed. The user suggests that the handler variable is being overwritten with the result of adapt_method_mode(), which might not be compatible with the async requirements of the ASGI setup.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. The Django codebase is in /workspace/django__django__3.2. I need to find the base.py file mentioned in the issue description. The path should be something like django/core/handlers/base.py.\n\nFirst, I'll check the directory structure to confirm.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n__init__.py  asgi.py  base.py  exception.py  wsgi.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/django__django__3.2]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great, the base.py file is present in the django/core/handlers directory. Now, I need to look into this file to see how the middleware is being processed. The issue description mentions line 58 of base.py in Django 3.1.4, but since we're working with Django 3.2, the line numbers might differ. However, the logic should be similar.\n\nThe problem seems to be that when a middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler is still being passed through the remaining middleware, which might not handle it correctly in an ASGI context. The user suggests that the adapt_method_mode() function is being called, which might return a synchronous handler that's then used in an async context, leading to the TypeError.\n\nLet me open the base.py file to see the relevant code.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[50, 60]</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py:\n    50\t            else:\n    51\t                middleware_is_async = middleware_can_async\n    52\t            try:\n    53\t                # Adapt handler, if needed.\n    54\t                handler = self.adapt_method_mode(\n    55\t                    middleware_is_async, handler, handler_is_async,\n    56\t                    debug=settings.DEBUG, name='middleware %s' % middleware_path,\n    57\t                )\n    58\t                mw_instance = middleware(handler)\n    59\t            except MiddlewareNotUsed as exc:\n    60\t                if settings.DEBUG:\n    61\t\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so lines 50-60 of base.py are where the middleware is being processed. Let's look at the code:\n\n50-52: Determine if the middleware is async.\n53-57: Adapt the handler using adapt_method_mode.\n58: Create an instance of the middleware with the adapted handler.\n59: Catch MiddlewareNotUsed exception.\n\nThe issue seems to be that when MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, the handler is still being passed through the remaining middleware. The user suggests that the adapt_method_mode() function is being called, which might return a handler that's not compatible with the async requirements of the ASGI setup.\n\nThe problem arises because when a middleware is marked as not used (raises MiddlewareNotUsed), the handler is still being adapted and passed to the next middleware, which might not handle it correctly. This could lead to a situation where a synchronous response is being treated as an asynchronous one, hence the TypeError.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps the adapt_method_mode() should only be called if the middleware is actually used. Alternatively, when MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, the handler should not be modified and passed through.\n\nLet me think. The adapt_method_mode function is responsible for converting the handler into a synchronous or asynchronous version based on the middleware's capabilities. If a middleware is not used, then the handler shouldn't be adapted for that middleware. However, in the current code, the handler is adapted even if the middleware is not used, which might cause issues.\n\nSo, the problem is that the handler is being adapted even when the middleware is not used. Therefore, the solution might be to move the adapt_method_mode call inside the try block, so that it's only executed if the middleware is actually used.\n\nWait, but the code is structured as follows:\n\n- Adapt the handler to the middleware's async capabilities.\n- Create the middleware instance with the adapted handler.\n- If MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, skip this middleware.\n\nBut the adaptation is done before checking if the middleware is used. So, even if the middleware is not used, the handler has already been adapted. This could lead to the handler being in a state that's not compatible with the remaining middleware.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach would be to adapt the handler only if the middleware is actually used. So, perhaps the adapt_method_mode should be called after the middleware instance is created and it doesn't raise MiddlewareNotUsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adapt_method_mode function should be called conditionally based on whether the middleware is used.\n\nLet me look into the adapt_method_mode function to understand what it does.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[100, 120]</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py:\n   100\t        \"\"\"\n   101\t        Adapt a method to be in the correct \"mode\":\n   102\t        - If is_async is False:\n   103\t          - Synchronous methods are left alone\n   104\t          - Asynchronous methods are wrapped with async_to_sync\n   105\t        - If is_async is True:\n   106\t          - Synchronous methods are wrapped with sync_to_async()\n   107\t          - Asynchronous methods are left alone\n   108\t        \"\"\"\n   109\t        if method_is_async is None:\n   110\t            method_is_async = asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(method)\n   111\t        if debug and not name:\n   112\t            name = name or 'method %s()' % method.__qualname__\n   113\t        if is_async:\n   114\t            if not method_is_async:\n   115\t                if debug:\n   116\t                    logger.debug('Synchronous %s adapted.', name)\n   117\t                return sync_to_async(method, thread_sensitive=True)\n   118\t        elif method_is_async:\n   119\t            if debug:\n   120\t                logger.debug('Asynchronous %s adapted.', name)\n   121\t\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, the adapt_method_mode function adapts a method to be either synchronous or asynchronous based on the is_async parameter. So, if is_async is True, it wraps synchronous methods with sync_to_async, and if is_async is False, it wraps asynchronous methods with async_to_sync.\n\nIn the context of the middleware processing, the handler is being adapted to the middleware's async capabilities. So, if the middleware is synchronous (middleware_is_async is False), then the handler is wrapped with async_to_sync if it's asynchronous. Conversely, if the middleware is asynchronous, the handler is wrapped with sync_to_async if it's synchronous.\n\nBut the problem is that when a middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler has already been adapted, which might not be correct. For example, if a middleware is supposed to be synchronous but is not used, the handler might have been adapted to be synchronous, but the next middleware in the chain might be asynchronous, leading to a mismatch.\n\nSo, the key issue is that the handler is being adapted even for middlewares that are not used. Therefore, the adaptation should only happen if the middleware is actually used.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps the adapt_method_mode call should be moved inside the try block, so that it's only executed if the middleware is successfully instantiated. That way, if MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, the handler isn't adapted for that middleware.\n\nLet me think about the current code flow:\n\n1. Determine if the middleware is async (middleware_is_async).\n2. Adapt the handler to the middleware's async mode.\n3. Create the middleware instance with the adapted handler.\n4. If MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, skip this middleware.\n\nThe problem is that step 2 happens before step 3, so even if the middleware is not used (step 4), the handler has already been adapted. This could lead to the handler being in a state that's not compatible with the remaining middlewares.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach would be to adapt the handler only after the middleware is successfully instantiated. So, the steps should be:\n\n1. Determine if the middleware is async (middleware_is_async).\n2. Create the middleware instance with the original handler.\n3. If MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, skip this middleware.\n4. Adapt the handler to the middleware's async mode.\n\nThis way, the adaptation only happens if the middleware is actually used.\n\nSo, the code should be modified to:\n\n- First, create the middleware instance with the original handler.\n- If MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, skip.\n- Otherwise, adapt the handler based on the middleware's async capabilities.\n\nThis would prevent the handler from being adapted if the middleware is not used.\n\nLet me check the current code again. The current code is:\n\n54-57: handler = self.adapt_method_mode(...)\n\n58: mw_instance = middleware(handler)\n\n59: except MiddlewareNotUsed:\n\nSo, the adaptation happens before creating the middleware instance. If the middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler has already been adapted, which might not be correct.\n\nTherefore, the fix would be to move the adaptation after the middleware instance is created. So, the code should be:\n\ntry:\n    mw_instance = middleware(handler)\nexcept MiddlewareNotUsed:\n    ...\nelse:\n    handler = self.adapt_method_mode(...)\n\nThis way, the adaptation only happens if the middleware is successfully instantiated.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the steps would be:\n\n- Try to create the middleware instance with the original handler.\n- If it raises MiddlewareNotUsed, skip.\n- Otherwise, adapt the handler based on the middleware's async capabilities.\n\nThis way, the handler is only adapted if the middleware is actually used, preventing the issue where the handler is adapted for a middleware that's not used.\n\nSo, the code in base.py should be modified to move the adaptation after the middleware instance is created.\n\nLet me confirm this by looking at the code again.\n\nOriginal code:\n\n53-57: Adapt the handler.\n\n58: Create the middleware instance with the adapted handler.\n\n59: Catch MiddlewareNotUsed.\n\nBut the problem is that the adaptation is done before creating the middleware instance. So, even if the middleware is not used, the handler has been adapted. This could lead to the handler being in a state that's not compatible with the remaining middlewares.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to first create the middleware instance with the original handler, then adapt the handler if the middleware is used.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\ntry:\n    mw_instance = middleware(handler)\nexcept MiddlewareNotUsed:\n    # Skip this middleware\nelse:\n    # Adapt the handler\n    handler = self.adapt_method_mode(...)\n\nThis way, the adaptation only happens if the middleware is successfully instantiated.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the fix would involve moving the adaptation code into the else block of the try-except statement.\n\nNow, I need to make this change in the base.py file.\n\nBut before making the change, I should confirm that this is the correct approach. Let me think about the implications.\n\nIf the middleware is not used, then the handler is not adapted. This means that the next middleware in the chain will receive the original handler, which may or may not be compatible with its async requirements. However, since the middleware is not used, it's possible that the next middleware is responsible for handling the handler correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adaptation should still happen even if the middleware is not used, but that's not the case here. The problem is that the adaptation is being done for a middleware that's not used, which is causing issues.\n\nTherefore, moving the adaptation after the middleware instance is created (i.e., only if it's used) should resolve the issue.\n\nSo, the steps to fix this are:\n\n1. In base.py, find the code block where the middleware is being processed.\n\n2. Move the adaptation code (lines 54-57) into the else block of the try-except statement.\n\n3.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nMiddlewareNotUsed leaves undesired side effects when loading middleware in ASGI context\nDescription\n\t\nI experienced strange issues when working with \u200bASGI , \u200bdjango-debug-toolbar and my own small middleware. It was hard problem to debug, I uploaded an example project here: \u200bhttps://github.com/hbielenia/asgi-djangotoolbar-bug (the name is misleading - I initially thought it's a bug with django-debug-toolbar).\nThe SESSION_FILE_PATH setting is intentionally broken to cause a 500 error. When starting the application and accessing /admin (any location really, but I wanted to leave it at a minimum and didn't add any views) it gives TypeError: object HttpResponse can't be used in 'await' expression. Commenting out asgi_djangotoolbar_bug.middleware.DummyMiddleware fixes the issue (in that I receive a 500 ImproperlyConfigured exception). I'm not sure about the overall role of django-debug-toolbar here - removing it causes Daphne to return a 500 error page but without debug information and there's no traceback in console either. I decided to leave it since it helped me approximate the causes of issue.\nI notice that in \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/3.1.4/django/core/handlers/base.py#L58 while MiddlewareNotUsed causes the loop to skip futher processing and go to next middleware, it does leave handler variable overwritten with output of self.adapt_method_mode(). On next pass, this handler is passed to next middleware instance, disregarding all the previous checks for (lack of) async support. This likely causes the middleware chain to be \"poisoned\" from this point onwards, resulting in last middleware in response cycle to return an HttpResponse as a synchronous middleware would, instead of coroutine that is expected.\nThis is probably avoided by adding async support to my middleware, but unless I'm missing something \u200bdocs indicate it should work as it is. It is my intention that it's applied only on synchronous requests, so I didn't make it async compatible on purpose. If it's intentional in Django that every middleware needs to support async if the application is run as ASGI app, the documentation should probably state that clearly. Though it kinda defeats the purpose of having async_capable = False flag in the first place.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is related to Django's middleware when running in an ASGI context. The user is experiencing a TypeError because an HttpResponse object is being used in an 'await' expression, which suggests that somewhere in the middleware chain, a synchronous response is being treated as an asynchronous one. The issue seems to stem from the MiddlewareNotUsed exception not properly handling the middleware chain when some middlewares are synchronous and others are asynchronous.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository. The uploaded directory is django__django__3.2, which is likely the Django 3.2 codebase. The issue description mentions that the problem occurs in the base.py file of the core handlers. Specifically, in Django 3.1.4, there's a line where MiddlewareNotUsed is handled, but the handler variable is overwritten with the result of self.adapt_method_mode(), which might be causing issues when the middleware chain is processed.\n\nThe user's example project uses Django Debug Toolbar and a custom middleware. When the custom middleware is included, it causes a TypeError, but commenting it out leads to a different error. The core of the problem seems to be that when a middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler is still being passed through the remaining middleware, which might not handle it correctly in an ASGI context.\n\nSo, the plan is to look into the Django core handlers, specifically the base.py file, and see how the middleware is being processed. The user suggests that the handler variable is being overwritten with the result of adapt_method_mode(), which might not be compatible with the async requirements of the ASGI setup.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. The Django codebase is in /workspace/django__django__3.2. I need to find the base.py file mentioned in the issue description.

However, the logic should be similar.\n\nThe problem seems to be that when a middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler is still being passed through the remaining middleware, which might not handle it correctly in an ASGI context.

The user suggests that the adapt_method_mode() function is being called, which might return a handler that's not compatible with the async requirements of the ASGI setup.\n\nThe problem arises because when a middleware is marked as not used (raises MiddlewareNotUsed), the handler is still being adapted and passed to the next middleware, which might not handle it correctly. This could lead to a situation where a synchronous response is being treated as an asynchronous one, hence the TypeError.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps the adapt_method_mode() should only be called if the middleware is actually used. Alternatively, when MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, the handler should not be modified and passed through.\n\nLet me think. The adapt_method_mode function is responsible for converting the handler into a synchronous or asynchronous version based on the middleware's capabilities. If a middleware is not used, then the handler shouldn't be adapted for that middleware. However, in the current code, the handler is adapted even if the middleware is not used, which might cause issues.\n\nSo, the problem is that the handler is being adapted even when the middleware is not used. Therefore, the solution might be to move the adapt_method_mode call inside the try block, so that it's only executed if the middleware is actually used.\n\nWait, but the code is structured as follows:\n\n- Adapt the handler to the middleware's async capabilities.\n- Create the middleware instance with the adapted handler.\n- If MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, skip this middleware.\n\nBut the adaptation is done before checking if the middleware is used. So, even if the middleware is not used, the handler has already been adapted. This could lead to the handler being in a state that's not compatible with the remaining middleware.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach would be to adapt the handler only if the middleware is actually used. So, perhaps the adapt_method_mode should be called after the middleware instance is created and it doesn't raise MiddlewareNotUsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adapt_method_mode function should be called conditionally based on whether the middleware is used.\n\nLet me look into the adapt_method_mode function to understand what it does.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_03", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py\", \"view_range\": [100, 120]}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/handlers/base.py:\n   100\t        \"\"\"\n   101\t        Adapt a method to be in the correct \"mode\":\n   102\t        - If is_async is False:\n   103\t          - Synchronous methods are left alone\n   104\t          - Asynchronous methods are wrapped with async_to_sync\n   105\t        - If is_async is True:\n   106\t          - Synchronous methods are wrapped with sync_to_async()\n   107\t          - Asynchronous methods are left alone\n   108\t        \"\"\"\n   109\t        if method_is_async is None:\n   110\t            method_is_async = asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(method)\n   111\t        if debug and not name:\n   112\t            name = name or 'method %s()' % method.__qualname__\n   113\t        if is_async:\n   114\t            if not method_is_async:\n   115\t                if debug:\n   116\t                    logger.debug('Synchronous %s adapted.', name)\n   117\t                return sync_to_async(method, thread_sensitive=True)\n   118\t        elif method_is_async:\n   119\t            if debug:\n   120\t                logger.debug('Asynchronous %s adapted.', name)\n   121\t\n", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_03", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, {"content": "Ah, the adapt_method_mode function adapts a method to be either synchronous or asynchronous based on the is_async parameter. So, if is_async is True, it wraps synchronous methods with sync_to_async, and if is_async is False, it wraps asynchronous methods with async_to_sync.\n\nIn the context of the middleware processing, the handler is being adapted to the middleware's async capabilities. So, if the middleware is synchronous (middleware_is_async is False), then the handler is wrapped with async_to_sync if it's asynchronous. Conversely, if the middleware is asynchronous, the handler is wrapped with sync_to_async if it's synchronous.\n\nBut the problem is that when a middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler has already been adapted, which might not be correct. For example, if a middleware is supposed to be synchronous but is not used, the handler might have been adapted to be synchronous, but the next middleware in the chain might be asynchronous, leading to a mismatch.\n\nSo, the key issue is that the handler is being adapted even for middlewares that are not used. Therefore, the adaptation should only happen if the middleware is actually used.\n\nTo fix this, perhaps the adapt_method_mode call should be moved inside the try block, so that it's only executed if the middleware is successfully instantiated. That way, if MiddlewareNotUsed is raised, the handler isn't adapted for that middleware.\n\nLet me think about the current code flow:\n\n1.

If the middleware raises MiddlewareNotUsed, the handler has already been adapted, which might not be correct.\n\nTherefore, the fix would be to move the adaptation after the middleware instance is created.
