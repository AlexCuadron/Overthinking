  "initial_issue": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n\n\nHere's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

It might be mathematically more convenient to have them return `oo` and `-oo`, respectively. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set#Extended_real_numbers for why these are valid answers mathematically. \n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY!

      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this task. So, the issue is about the Min() and Max() functions in the SymPy library. Currently, when they are called with no arguments, they raise a ValueError. The goal is to change this behavior so that Min() returns oo (infinity) and Max() returns -oo (negative infinity) when there are no arguments. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository to find where these functions are defined. Since the repository is in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.4, I should start by exploring the directory to locate the relevant files.\n\nSymPy is a large library, so the functions Min and Max are probably part of the core modules. I recall that in SymPy, these functions are likely defined in the functions module. Let me check the directory structure to find where they are located.\n\nI'll start by listing the contents of the repository to get an idea of its structure. Then, I can search for files that might contain the definitions of Min and Max.\n\nOnce I find the correct file, I need to modify the code so that when Min() or Max() is called without arguments, they return oo or -oo instead of raising an error. I should also consider any edge cases, like when the arguments are empty lists or other cases where the functions are called without arguments.\n\nAfter making the changes, I need to write a script to reproduce the error, run it to confirm the fix, and ensure that the new behavior works as expected.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure.\n\nFirst, I'll list the contents of the /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.4 directory to see what's inside.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\nls /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.4\n</parameter>\n",
