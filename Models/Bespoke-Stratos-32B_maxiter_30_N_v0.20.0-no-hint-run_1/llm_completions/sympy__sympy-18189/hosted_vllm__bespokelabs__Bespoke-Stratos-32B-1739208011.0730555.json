By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

The problem is that the diophantine function in SymPy is returning incomplete results when the order of symbols is changed, even with permute=True. The user provided an example where swapping the order of symbols (m,n) vs (n,m) leads to different results. The first case returns multiple solutions, but the second case only returns one solution. This inconsistency needs to be fixed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. The uploaded directory is sympy__sympy__1.6, which is likely the source code for SymPy version 1.6. I should look into the diophantine module to find where the function is defined.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository.

The problem is that the diophantine function in SymPy is returning incomplete results when the order of symbols is changed, even with permute=True. The user provided an example where swapping the order of symbols (m,n) vs (n,m) leads to different results. The first case returns multiple solutions, but the second case only returns one solution. This inconsistency needs to be fixed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. The uploaded directory is sympy__sympy__1.6, which is likely the source code for SymPy version 1.6. I should look into the diophantine module to find where the function is defined.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository. The diophantine module is probably under sympy/solvers/diophantine.py or something similar.
