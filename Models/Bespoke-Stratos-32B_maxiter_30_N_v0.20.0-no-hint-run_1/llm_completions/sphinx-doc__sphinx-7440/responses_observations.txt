################################################################################
INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls
</IMPORTANT>


Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

- https://travis-ci.org/github/williamdes/phpmyadmintest/jobs/671352365#L328



</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is that there's a duplicate term in the glossary.rst file, specifically "mysql" and "MySQL" which are considered duplicates because they differ only in case. The error is being treated as a warning, but in this case, it's being treated as an error, so the build is failing.

First, I need to understand the structure of the repository. The uploaded directory is sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0, which probably contains the Sphinx documentation files. The issue is in the glossary.rst file located in the doc directory. The error message points to line 243, but the blame link shows line 234. Hmm, maybe the line numbers have shifted a bit.

The steps to reproduce involve cloning the phpmyadmin repository, installing Sphinx, and running make html. But since I'm working in the /workspace directory, I need to find the relevant files here. The uploaded files are in /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0, so I should check that directory.

Let me start by exploring the directory structure to find the glossary.rst file. I can use the str_replace_editor function to view the files. Let's first check the contents of the /workspace directory.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Great, the glossary.rst file is present in the /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0/doc directory. Now, I need to open this file and check for duplicate terms, specifically "mysql" and "MySQL". The error message mentions line 243, but the blame link points to line 234. Since line numbers can vary, I should look for both terms in the glossary.

Let me view the glossary.rst file to find the duplicate entries.

---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0/doc/glossary.rst:
     1	.. _glossary:
     2	
     3	Glossary
     4	========
     5	
     6	.. glossary::
     7	
     8	   builder
     9	      A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes
    10	      parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
    11	      translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
    12	      use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the
    13	      documentation, or build coverage information.
    14	
    15	      See :doc:`/usage/builders/index` for an overview over Sphinx's built-in
    16	      builders.
    17	
    18	   configuration directory
    19	      The directory containing :file:`conf.py`.  By default, this is the same as
    20	      the :term:`source directory`, but can be set differently with the **-c**
    21	      command-line option.
    22	
    23	   directive
    24	      A reStructuredText markup element that allows marking a block of content
    25	      with special meaning.  Directives are supplied not only by docutils, but
    26	      Sphinx and custom extensions can add their own.  The basic directive
    27	      syntax looks like this:
    28	
    29	      .. sourcecode:: rst
    30	
    31	         .. directivename:: argument ...
    32	            :option: value
    33	
    34	            Content of the directive.
    35	
    36	      See :ref:`rst-directives` for more information.
    37	
    38	   document name
    39	      Since reST source files can have different extensions (some people like
    40	      ``.txt``, some like ``.rst`` -- the extension can be configured with
    41	      :confval:`source_suffix`) and different OSes have different path
    42	      separators, Sphinx abstracts them: :dfn:`document names` are always
    43	      relative to the :term:`source directory`, the extension is stripped, and
    44	      path separators are converted to slashes.  All values, parameters and such
    45	      referring to "documents" expect such document names.
    46	
    47	      Examples for document names are ``index``, ``library/zipfile``, or
    48	      ``reference/datamodel/types``.  Note that there is no leading or trailing
    49	      slash.
    50	
    51	   domain
    52	      A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\ s
    53	      and :term:`role`\ s) to describe and link to :term:`object`\ s belonging
    54	      together, e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role
    55	      names in a domain have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``.
    56	
    57	      Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of
    58	      documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also
    59	      means that extensions that support the documentation of whole new
    60	      languages are much easier to write.
    61	
    62	      For more information, refer to :doc:`/usage/restructuredtext/domains`.
    63	
    64	   environment
    65	      A structure where information about all documents under the root is saved,
    66	      and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled after the
    67	      parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read and parse new and

RESPONSE:
The glossary.rst file is quite long, but the error mentions a duplicate term for "mysql" and "MySQL". Let me search for these terms in the file. Since the error is about a duplicate term, there must be two entries with the same term, differing only in case.

Looking through the file, I don't see any obvious entries for "mysql" or "MySQL" in the provided snippet. The current view only shows up to line 101, so I need to check the rest of the file.

Let me view the entire glossary.rst file to find the duplicate entries.

     3	Glossary
     4	========
     5	
     6	.. glossary::
     7	
     8	   builder
     9	      A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builders.Builder`) that takes
    10	      parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
    11	      translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
    12	      use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the
    13	      documentation, or build coverage information.
    14	
    15	      See :doc:`/usage/builders/index` for an overview over Sphinx's built-in
    16	      builders.
    17	
    18	   configuration directory
    19	      The directory containing :file:`conf.py`.  By default, this is the same as
    20	      the :term:`source directory`, but can be set differently with the **-c**
    21	      command-line option.
    22	
    23	   directive
    24	      A reStructuredText markup element that allows marking a block of content
    25	      with special meaning.  Directives are supplied not only by docutils, but
    26	      Sphinx and custom extensions can add their own.  The basic directive
    27	      syntax looks like this:
    28	
    29	      .. sourcecode:: rst
    30	
    31	         .. directivename:: argument ...
    32	            :option: value
    33	
    34	            Content of the directive.
    35	
    36	      See :ref:`rst-directives` for more information.
    37	
    38	   document name
    39	      Since reST source files can have different extensions (some people like
    40	      ``.txt``, some like ``.rst`` -- the extension can be configured with
    41	      :confval:`source_suffix`) and different OSes have different path
    42	      separators, Sphinx abstracts them: :dfn:`document names` are always
    43	      relative to the :term:`source directory`, the extension is stripped, and
    44	      path separators are converted to slashes.  All values, parameters and such
    45	      referring to "documents" expect such document names.
    46	
    47	      Examples for document names are ``index``, ``library/zipfile``, or
    48	      ``reference/datamodel/types``.  Note that there is no leading or trailing
    49	      slash.
    50	
    51	   domain
    52	      A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\ s
    53	      and :term:`role`\ s) to describe and link to :term:`object`\ s belonging
    54	      together, e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role
    55	      names in a domain have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``.
    56	
    57	      Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of
    58	      documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also
    59	      means that extensions that support the documentation of whole new
    60	      languages are much easier to write.
    61	
    62	      For more information, refer to :doc:`/usage/restructuredtext/domains`.
    63	
    64	   environment
    65	      A structure where information about all documents under the root is saved,
    66	      and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled after the
    67	      parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read and parse new and
    68	      changed documents.
    69	
    70	   extension
    71	     A custom :term:`role`, :term:`directive` or other aspect of Sphinx that
    72	     allows users to modify any aspect of the build process within Sphinx.
    73	
    74	     For more information, refer to :doc:`/usage/extensions/index`.
    75	
    76	   master document
    77	      The document that contains the root :rst:dir:`toctree` directive.
    78	
    79	   object
    80	      The basic building block of Sphinx documentation.  Every "object
    81	      directive" (e.g. :rst:dir:`function` or :rst:dir:`object`) creates such a
    82	      block; and most objects can be cross-referenced to.

    86	      It usually caused from Sphinx extensions which is using deprecated.
    87	      See also :ref:`when-deprecation-warnings-are-displayed`.

RESPONSE:
Hmm, the provided view of the glossary.rst file doesn't show any entries for "mysql" or "MySQL". The current view only goes up to line 101, but the error mentions line 243. That means the duplicate terms are likely further down in the file.

I need to check the entire file for entries that have the same term but different cases. Since the error is about "mysql" and "MySQL", I should look for two entries where one is "mysql" and the other is "MySQL".

Let me search for "mysql" in the glossary.rst file. Since the file is long, I can use the str_replace_editor function to search for the term.

RESPONSE:
Wait, the glossary.rst file only has 100 lines, but the error mentions line 243. That's conflicting. The user provided an issue description that refers to a specific line number, but according to the file in the workspace, the line count is only 100. This suggests that there might be a discrepancy between the repository in the workspace and the one mentioned in the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the file in the workspace is not the correct one. Let me check the path again. The user mentioned that the repository is in /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0, and the glossary.rst is under doc. But according to the wc command, the file has 100 lines, which doesn't match the error's line number.

This is confusing. Let me try to find the correct file. Maybe the user uploaded a different version of the repository. Let me check the contents of the doc directory again.

The directory structure seems correct, and the glossary.rst file is present. However, the wc command showed that the file has only 100 lines, but the error mentions line 243. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the file in the workspace is not the same as the one in the issue description.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the line number. Let me check the contents of the glossary.rst file again, perhaps there are entries for "mysql" and "MySQL" that are causing the duplicate term warning.

Since the file has 100 lines, I can view the entire file again and search for "mysql" and "MySQL".

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The entire glossary.rst file has only 100 lines, and there are no entries for "mysql" or "MySQL". This suggests that the issue might not be in this particular glossary.rst file. However, the user mentioned that the error occurs in the phpmyadmin repository, but the workspace contains the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository. There might be a confusion here.

Wait, the user said they uploaded a Python code repository in the directory sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0. But the issue description refers to the phpmyadmin repository. This is conflicting. Perhaps the user intended to upload the phpmyadmin repository but mistakenly uploaded the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository. Alternatively, the issue is in the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository.

Given that the user provided the issue description for the phpmyadmin repository, but the workspace contains the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository, there's a mismatch. However, the user instructed to work with the files in the workspace. Therefore, I need to proceed with the files available in the workspace.

Since the glossary.rst file in the workspace does not contain the terms "mysql" or "MySQL", perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Maybe the user made a mistake in the issue description, or perhaps the repository in the workspace is not the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in another file. Let me check other files in the doc directory for mentions of "mysql" or "MySQL".

RESPONSE:
The grep command returned exit code 1, which means there were no matches found for 'mysql' in the doc directory. This further confirms that the terms "mysql" and "MySQL" are not present in the files under the doc directory in the workspace.

This is perplexing because the issue description clearly mentions a duplicate term in the glossary.rst file. However, the files in the workspace do not contain those terms. There must be a misunderstanding here.

Perhaps the user intended to upload a different repository, or perhaps the issue is in a different part of the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository. Alternatively, maybe the error is in a different file.

Let me check the entire workspace for any mentions of "mysql" or "MySQL".

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -r 'mysql' /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:

[The command completed with exit code 1.]
[Current working directory: /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0]
[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 1]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The grep command still returns exit code 1, indicating that there are no occurrences of 'mysql' in the entire sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository. This suggests that the issue described in the problem is not present in the provided repository. There must be a mistake in the task description or the uploaded files.

Given that, perhaps the user intended to upload a different repository, such as the phpmyadmin repository mentioned in the issue description. However, since the workspace contains the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository, and there are no mentions of 'mysql' in it, I'm unable to proceed with the task as described.

I need to clarify this with the user. However, since the user hasn't provided any further input, I'll have to make an assumption. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the repository name, and the actual repository is different. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is in a different part of the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository.

Alternatively, maybe the error is in the configuration files. Let me check the conf.py file to see if there are any references to 'mysql'.

LAST RESPONSE:
The conf.py file also does not contain any mentions of 'mysql' or 'MySQL'. This further confirms that the issue described in the problem is not present in the provided repository. There must be a mistake in the task description or the uploaded files.

Given that, I need to inform the user that the provided repository does not contain the terms causing the duplicate term warning. However, since the user hasn't provided any further input, I'll have to make an assumption. Perhaps the user intended to upload a different repository, such as the phpmyadmin repository mentioned in the issue description.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is in a different part of the sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.0 repository. However, based on the current files, there's no evidence of the problem.

Since the user instructed to work with the files in the workspace, and there's no occurrence of 'mysql' or 'MySQL' in the repository, I'm unable to proceed with the task as described. I need to inform the user that the required changes cannot be made because the terms are not present in the provided files.
