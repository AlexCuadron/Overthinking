By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added).

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nDecorated __init__ doesn't show up in docs\nSubject: Decorated __init__ won't be documented. I'm working on [tensorpack](github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n- I have `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True`, so `__init__` will be documented. But if I decorate the `__init__` method, it will not show up in docs.\r\nI decorate it with `functools.wraps`, so the decorated object still has the same `__doc__`.\r\nI've found that the bug is due to this commit: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/commit/bbfd0d058aecf85bd3b711a846c83e2fe00fa136\r\nI've printed the relevant variables in that function:\r\n```\r\nqualname='DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__'\r\nname='__init__'\r\nobj.__doc__ has contents\r\n```\r\nAnd the root cause of the issue is in this line of code:\r\n```python\r\ncls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\r\n```\r\nBecause `obj` now is not the method itself, but a decorated method, its `__globals__` does not contain the class anymore. This makes sphinx think it's not a method, i.e. `cls_is_owner=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment info\r\n- OS: <Unix/Linux/Mac/Win/other with version>: ArchLinux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version:1.6.5\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when a class's `__init__` method is decorated, Sphinx doesn't document it even though `napoleon_include_init_with_doc` is set to True. The root cause seems to be in the commit mentioned, where the code checks if the `__globals__` of the decorated method contains the class. Since the decorator wraps the method, its `__globals__` might not point to the class's namespace anymore, leading Sphinx to think it's not a method of the class and thus not document it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Sphinx repository. The uploaded directory is sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2, which I assume is the Sphinx source code. The issue is related to how Sphinx handles decorated `__init__` methods. The commit mentioned in the issue is from the Sphinx repository, so I need to find where that code is located.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the files and find the relevant code.\n\nFirst, I need to find the file where the commit mentioned (bbfd0d058aecf85bd3b711a846c83e2fe00fa136) is located. The commit message might give some clues, but since I don't have direct access to the commit, I'll have to look for the code that handles method documentation.\n\nThe issue mentions that the problem is in the line `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`. So, I need to find where this line is in the codebase. This is likely in the part of Sphinx that processes methods and determines if they belong to a class.\n\nSphinx's documentation generation for classes and methods is handled in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` module. Specifically, the `ClassDocumenter` and `MethodDocumenter` classes might be involved here.\n\nLet me check the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view this file.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py:\n     1\t\"\"\"\n     2\t    sphinx.ext.autodoc\n     3\t    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n     4\t\n     5\t    Automatically insert docstrings for functions, classes or whole modules into\n     6\t    the doctree, thus avoiding duplication between docstrings and documentation\n     7\t    for those who like elaborate docstrings.\n     8\t\n     9\t    :copyright: Copyright 2007-2020 by the Sphinx team, see AUTHORS.\n    10\t    :license: BSD, see LICENSE for details.\n    11\t\"\"\"\n    12\t\n    13\timport importlib\n    14\timport re\n    15\timport warnings\n    16\tfrom inspect import Parameter, Signature\n    17\tfrom types import ModuleType\n    18\tfrom typing import (\n    19\t    Any, Callable, Dict, Iterator, List, Optional, Sequence, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union\n    20\t)\n    21\t\n    22\tfrom docutils.statemachine import StringList\n    23\t\n    24\timport sphinx\n    25\tfrom sphinx.application import Sphinx\n    26\tfrom sphinx.config import Config, ENUM\n    27\tfrom sphinx.deprecation import RemovedInSphinx40Warning, RemovedInSphinx50Warning\n    28\tfrom sphinx.environment import BuildEnvironment\n    29\tfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc.importer import import_object, get_module_members, get_object_members\n    30\tfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock import mock\n    31\tfrom sphinx.locale import _, __\n    32\tfrom sphinx.pycode import ModuleAnalyzer, PycodeError\n    33\tfrom sphinx.util import inspect\n    34\tfrom sphinx.util import logging\n    35\tfrom sphinx.util.docstrings import extract_metadata, prepare_docstring\n    36\tfrom sphinx.util.inspect import getdoc, object_description, safe_getattr, stringify_signature\n    37\tfrom sphinx.util.typing import stringify as stringify_typehint\n    38\t\n    39\tif False:\n    40\t    # For type annotation\n    41\t    from typing import Type  # NOQA # for python3.5.1\n    42\t    from sphinx.ext.autodoc.directive import DocumenterBridge\n    43\t\n    44\t\n    45\tlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n    46\t\n    47\t\n    48\t# This type isn't exposed directly in any modules, but can be found\n    49\t# here in most Python versions\n    50\tMethodDescriptorType = type(type.__subclasses__)\n    51\t\n    52\t\n    53\t#: extended signature RE: with explicit module name separated by ::\n    54\tpy_ext_sig_re = re.compile(\n    55\t    r'''^ ([\\w.]+::)?

The issue seems to be related to how Sphinx determines if a method belongs to a class, especially when the method is decorated. The problem arises because the decorator wraps the method, and when Sphinx tries to access the `__globals__` attribute of the decorated method, it doesn't find the class, leading to the method not being documented.\n\nFrom the issue description, the problematic code is in the commit mentioned, and the line in question is `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`. This line is likely part of the logic that checks if the method belongs to a class. If the method is decorated, its `__globals__` might not contain the class, so this lookup fails, and Sphinx doesn't document the method.\n\nTo fix this, we need to find a way to correctly determine the class that the method belongs to, even if it's decorated. One possible approach is to use the `__qualname__` attribute of the method, which should include the class name. For example, if the method is `__init__` of a class `DistributedTrainerReplicated`, the `__qualname__` would be `DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__`.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of relying on `obj.__globals__`, we can parse the `__qualname__` to get the class name. Let's see where this code is located.\n\nI need to find the part of the code that checks if the method is part of a class. This is likely in the `ClassDocumenter` or `MethodDocumenter` classes. Let me check the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/members.py` file, which might contain the relevant code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. Let me search for the line `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` in that file.\n\nBut since the file is large, I can use the `grep` command to search for the relevant line.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>grep -r \"cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\" /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2/sphinx/ext/autodoc</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n\n[The command completed with exit code 1.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 1]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hmm, the `grep` command didn't find any matches, which suggests that the exact line `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` isn't present in the codebase.

Therefore, I need to find the equivalent code in the current version.\n\nLet me think about how Sphinx determines if a method belongs to a class. The `ClassDocumenter` and `MethodDocumenter` classes are responsible for documenting classes and methods. The `can_document_member` method in these classes might be where the check is performed.\n\nLooking back at the `__init__.py` file, there's a `Documenter` class, and subclasses like `ClassDocumenter` and `MethodDocumenter` might be defined elsewhere.

But if I decorate the `__init__` method, it will not show up in docs.\r\nI decorate it with `functools.wraps`, so the decorated object still has the same `__doc__`.\r\nI've found that the bug is due to this commit: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/commit/bbfd0d058aecf85bd3b711a846c83e2fe00fa136\r\nI've printed the relevant variables in that function:\r\n```\r\nqualname='DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__'\r\nname='__init__'\r\nobj.__doc__ has contents\r\n```\r\nAnd the root cause of the issue is in this line of code:\r\n```python\r\ncls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\r\n```\r\nBecause `obj` now is not the method itself, but a decorated method, its `__globals__` does not contain the class anymore. This makes sphinx think it's not a method, i.e. `cls_is_owner=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment info\r\n- OS: <Unix/Linux/Mac/Win/other with version>: ArchLinux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version:1.6.5\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

So, the problem is that when a class's `__init__` method is decorated, Sphinx doesn't document it even though `napoleon_include_init_with_doc` is set to True. The root cause seems to be in the commit mentioned, where the code checks if the `__globals__` of the decorated method contains the class. Since the decorator wraps the method, its `__globals__` might not point to the class's namespace anymore, leading Sphinx to think it's not a method of the class and thus not document it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Sphinx repository. The uploaded directory is sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2, which I assume is the Sphinx source code. The issue is related to how Sphinx handles decorated `__init__` methods.

So, I need to find where this line is in the codebase. This is likely in the part of Sphinx that processes methods and determines if they belong to a class.\n\nSphinx's documentation generation for classes and methods is handled in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` module.

The issue seems to be related to how Sphinx determines if a method belongs to a class, especially when the method is decorated. The problem arises because the decorator wraps the method, and when Sphinx tries to access the `__globals__` attribute of the decorated method, it doesn't find the class, leading to the method not being documented.\n\nFrom the issue description, the problematic code is in the commit mentioned, and the line in question is `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`. This line is likely part of the logic that checks if the method belongs to a class. If the method is decorated, its `__globals__` might not contain the class, so this lookup fails, and Sphinx doesn't document the method.\n\nTo fix this, we need to find a way to correctly determine the class that the method belongs to, even if it's decorated. One possible approach is to use the `__qualname__` attribute of the method, which should include the class name. For example, if the method is `__init__` of a class `DistributedTrainerReplicated`, the `__qualname__` would be `DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__`.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of relying on `obj.__globals__`, we can parse the `__qualname__` to get the class name. Let's see where this code is located.\n\nI need to find the part of the code that checks if the method is part of a class. This is likely in the `ClassDocumenter` or `MethodDocumenter` classes. Let me check the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/members.py` file, which might contain the relevant code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file.
