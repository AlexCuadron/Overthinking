################################################################################
INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/psf__requests__2.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory psf__requests__2.0. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
quote qop options in Digest Auth
Based on RFC2617 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), the value of
'qop-options' directive should be quoted with double quotes:

```
qop-options
     This directive is optional, but is made so only for backward
     compatibility with RFC 2069 [6]; it SHOULD be used by all
     implementations compliant with this version of the Digest
     scheme. If present, it is a quoted string of one or more
     tokens indicating the "quality of protection" values supported by
     the server.  The value "auth" indicates authentication; the
     value "auth-int" indicates authentication with
     integrity protection; see the
```

curl comamnd-line tool also appends these quotes. You can see this
by `curl -v --digest --user user:passwd http://example.com/digest-auth`.
Unfortunately, some minor server-side implementations seem to be sensitive
on this difference.


</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- 

REASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's tackle this task. So, the issue is about the 'qop-options' directive in Digest Auth not being quoted with double quotes as per RFC2617. The problem is that some servers are sensitive to this, so we need to make sure that the 'qop-options' value is properly quoted.

First, I need to understand where in the requests library this 'qop-options' is being handled. Since this is related to Digest authentication, I should look into the auth module of the requests library. The requests library has an auth module that handles different authentication schemes, including Digest.

Let me start by exploring the repository structure. The uploaded directory is psf__requests__2.0, which is likely the requests library version 2.0. I need to find the relevant files where Digest authentication is implemented.

I'll first check the directory structure to see where the auth module is located. Probably under requests/auth.py or something similar. Let me use the str_replace_editor function to view the files.

First, I'll list the contents of the workspace directory to see the structure.

================================================================================
LAST RESPONSE:
Okay, so the requests library is in the 'requests' directory under the workspace. The relevant file for Digest authentication is likely 'auth.py' inside the 'requests' directory. Let me check the contents of that file.
