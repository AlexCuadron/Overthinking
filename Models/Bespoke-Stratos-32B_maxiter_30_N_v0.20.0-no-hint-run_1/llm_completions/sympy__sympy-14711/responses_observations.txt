INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is that when we try to sum a list containing a vector and a zero multiplied by a vector, it raises a TypeError. The error occurs because the sum function is trying to add a zero (which is not a Vector) to the Vector. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. The code is in the directory /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1. Let me start by exploring the directory to find where the Vector class is defined. The error trace points to vector.py in the sympy.physics.vector module. So, the file should be located in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py.

I'll first check the current code to see how the Vector class handles addition. The error happens in the __add__ method of the Vector class. The code tries to check if the other operand is a Vector, and if not, raises a TypeError. However, when we have 0 * N.x, which is a scalar multiplication, the result should be a Vector. But in this case, it seems that 0 * N.x is not being treated as a Vector, hence the error.

Wait, but in SymPy, multiplying a vector by zero should return a zero vector, right? So perhaps there's a bug in how scalar multiplication is handled. Let me think. When you multiply a vector by a scalar, it should return a Vector. But in this case, 0 * N.x might be returning a scalar zero instead of a zero vector. That would explain why the sum fails, because the list contains a Vector and a scalar zero, which is not a Vector.

So the problem is that 0 * N.x is not returning a Vector. Let me check the code for scalar multiplication. The Vector class probably has a __mul__ method that handles scalar multiplication. Let me look into that.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is in how the sum function is handling the elements. The sum function starts with the first element and adds the next elements to it. So if the first element is a Vector, and the next element is a scalar zero, then adding a scalar to a Vector would fail. But in this case, the list is [N.x, 0*N.x]. So the first element is a Vector, the second is 0*N.x. If 0*N.x is a scalar zero, then adding that to the Vector would fail.

Wait, but 0*N.x should be a Vector. Let me check the code for scalar multiplication. The Vector class probably has a __mul__ method that handles scalar multiplication. Let me look into the Vector class's __mul__ method.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when the scalar is zero, the result is a scalar zero instead of a zero vector. That would be a bug. So the fix would be to ensure that scalar multiplication by zero returns a zero vector.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Find the Vector class definition in vector.py.
2. Check the __mul__ method to see how scalar multiplication is handled.
3. Ensure that when a scalar is multiplied by a Vector, even if the scalar is zero, the result is a Vector (specifically, a zero vector).
4. Modify the code if necessary to handle this case.

Let me start by navigating to the vector.py file. The repository is in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1. Let me check the directory structure.

First, I'll list the contents of the workspace directory to see where the sympy module is located.

Okay, the sympy module is in the 'sympy' directory under /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1. So the Vector class should be in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py. Let me confirm that.

LAST RESPONSE:
The Vector class is defined in vector.py. So the file we need to edit is /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/sympy/physics/vector/vector.py.

Now, let's look at the code in vector.py to find the __mul__ method for scalar multiplication. The error occurs when trying to add a Vector and a scalar zero. So the problem is that 0 * N.x is not returning a Vector. Let's see why.

First, I need to check how scalar multiplication is handled in the Vector class. Let's open vector.py and look for the __mul__ method.
