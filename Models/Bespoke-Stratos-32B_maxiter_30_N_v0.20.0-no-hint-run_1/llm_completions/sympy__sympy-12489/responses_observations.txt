INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

<uploaded_files>
/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory sympy__sympy__1.0. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
combinatorics.Permutation can't be subclassed properly
I stumbled across a subclassing issue with `combinatorics.Permutation`:
The object creation is done in `Permutation.__new__`, but internally the function `_af_new` is used (which itself is a reference to the static method `Permutation._af_new`). This method eventually creates the object calling `Basic.__new__(Perm, perm)` (`Perm` is a reference to `Permutation`).
In the end, this makes subclassing `Permutation` impossible (besides overriding `Permutation._af_new` as always instances of `Permutation` are returned.

An elegant solution would be to stick to Python's instance creation mechanisms, i.e. use classmethods where appropriate (`__new__` is one) and use the mandatory reference to the class (the first argument of a classmethod) the method is called on for instance creation.

I'm completely new to sympy development and encountered this issue whilst trying to subclass `Permutation`. Therefore I'm not aware of any side effects changing the instance creation probably has. (I monkeypatched it locally and ran the tests, all succeeded.)

Maybe there is a coherent explanation why the implementation is as it is and should not be changed?

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is that the Permutation class in SymPy's combinatorics module can't be subclassed properly because of how instances are created. The current implementation uses a static method _af_new which ends up creating instances of Permutation directly, bypassing the subclass's __new__ method. So, when someone tries to subclass Permutation, their subclass's __new__ isn't called, leading to issues.

First, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. The uploaded directory is sympy__sympy__1.0, which probably contains the source code for SymPy version 1.0. I should look into the combinatorics module, specifically the Permutation class.

Let me start by exploring the repository to find where the Permutation class is defined. I'll check the combinatorics directory. The Permutation class is likely in a file like permutation.py or something similar.

Once I find the Permutation class, I need to look at its __new__ method and the _af_new function. The issue says that _af_new is a static method that's called, and it uses Basic.__new__(Perm, perm), where Perm is Permutation. This bypasses the subclass's __new__ method because it's explicitly creating a Permutation instance instead of using the subclass.

To fix this, the solution is to use Python's instance creation mechanisms properly. That means using class methods where appropriate and ensuring that when a subclass is used, its __new__ method is called instead of the base class's.

So, the plan is to modify the _af_new method (or wherever necessary) to use the class that's being instantiated, rather than hardcoding Permutation. This way, when a subclass is created, its __new__ method will be called.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Locate the Permutation class in the repository.
2. Examine the __new__ method and the _af_new function.
3. Modify the code so that when creating a new instance, it uses the class that's being called, not the base Permutation class.
4. Test the changes by subclassing Permutation and ensuring that the subclass's __new__ is called.

First, I need to find the Permutation class. Let's start by looking in the combinatorics directory. I'll check the files there.

I'll use the str_replace_editor function to view the files. Let's start by listing the contents of the combinatorics directory.

   274	    [0, 2, 1]
   275	
   276	    Singletons are not shown when printing with one exception: the largest
   277	    element is always shown -- as a singleton if necessary:
   278

   282	    (1 2)(10)
   283

   479	    Permutations Notation
   480	    =====================
   481	
   482	    Permutations are commonly represented in disjoint cycle or array forms.
   483	
   484	    Array Notation and 2-line Form
   485	    ------------------------------------
   486	
   487	    In the 2-line form, the elements and their final positions are shown
   488	    as a matrix with 2 rows:
   489	
   490	    [0    1    2     ... n-1]
   491	    [p(0) p(1) p(2)  ... p(n-1)]
   492	
   493	    Since the first line is always range(n), where n is the size of p,
   494	    it is sufficient to represent the permutation by the second line,
   495	    referred to as the "array form" of the permutation. This is entered
   496	    in brackets as the argument to the Permutation class:
   497	
   498	    >>> p = Permutation([0, 2, 1]); p
   499	    Permutation([0, 2, 1])
   500	
   501	    Given i in range(p.size), the permutation maps i to i^p
   502	
   503	    >>> [i^p for i in range(p.size)]
   504	    [0, 2, 1]
   505	
   506	    The composite of two permutations p*q means first apply p, then q, so
   507	    i^(p*q) = (i^p)^q which is i^p^q according to Python precedence rules:
   508	
   509	    >>> q = Permutation([2, 1, 0])
   510	    >>> [i^p^q for i in range(3)]
   511	    [2, 0, 1]
   512	    >>> [i^(p*q) for i in range(3)]
   513	    [2, 0, 1]
   514	
   515	    One can use also the notation p(i) = i^p, but then the composition
   516	    rule is (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)), not p(q(i)):
   517	
   518	    >>> [(p*q)(i) for i in range(p.size)]
   519	    [2, 0, 1]
   520	    >>> [q(p(i)) for i in range(p.size)]
   521	    [2, 0, 1]

   523	    [1, 2, 0]
   524	
   525	    Disjoint Cycle Notation
   526	    -----------------------
   527	
   528	    In disjoint cycle notation, only the elements that have shifted are
   529	    indicated. In the above case, the 2 and 1 switched places. This can
   530	    be entered in two ways:
   531	
   532	    >>> Permutation(1, 2) == Permutation([[1, 2]]) == p
   533	    True
   534	
   535	    Only the relative ordering of elements in a cycle matter:
   536	
   537	    >>> Permutation(1,2,3) == Permutation(2,3,1) == Permutation(3,1,2)
   538	    True
   539	
   540	    The disjoint cycle notation is convenient when representing permutations
   541	    that have several cycles in them:
   542	
   543	    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3, 5) == Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
   544	    True
   545	
   546	    It also provides some economy in entry when computing products of
   547	    permutations that are written in disjoint cycle notation:
   548	
   549	    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(1, 3)(2, 3)
   550	    Permutation([0, 3, 2, 1])
   551	    >>> _ == Permutation([[1, 2]])*Permutation([[1, 3]])*Permutation([[2, 3]])
   552	    True
   553	
   554	    Entering a singleton in a permutation is a way to indicate the size of the
   555	    permutation. The ``size`` keyword can also be used.
   556	
   557	    Array-form entry:
   558	
   559	    >>> Permutation([[1, 2], [9]])
   560	    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
   561	    >>> Permutation([[1, 2]], size=10)
   562	    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
   563	
   564	    Cyclic-form entry:
   565	
   566	    >>> Permutation(1, 2, size=10)
   567	    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
   568	    >>> Permutation(9)(1, 2)
   569	    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)
   570	
   571	    Caution: no singleton containing an element larger than the largest
   572	    in any previous cycle can be entered. This is an important difference
   573	    in how Permutation and Cycle handle the __call__ syntax. A singleton
   574	    argument at the start of a Permutation performs instantiation of the
   575	    Permutation and is permitted:
   576	
   577	    >>> Permutation(5)
   578	    Permutation([], size=6)
   579

RESPONSE:
Okay, so the Permutation class is defined in permutations.py. The file is quite long, but I need to find the __new__ method and the _af_new function mentioned in the issue description.

Looking through the code, the Permutation class is a subclass of Basic. The __new__ method is likely where the instance creation happens. The issue mentions that the _af_new function is a static method that's called, and it uses Basic.__new__(Perm, perm), where Perm is Permutation. This is causing the subclass's __new__ method to not be called.

I need to find where _af_new is defined and how it's used. Let's search for _af_new in the file.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, so the _af_new function is a static method of the Permutation class. It takes a permutation in array form (perm) and creates a new Permutation instance using Basic.__new__(Perm, perm). This is the problem because when subclassing Permutation, this static method is called, which explicitly creates a Perm (which is Permutation) instance, bypassing the subclass's __new__ method.

The issue is that when a subclass is created, say MyPermutation, and someone tries to create an instance of MyPermutation, the _af_new method is called, which uses Basic.__new__(Perm, perm), where Perm is Permutation. This results in a Permutation instance being created instead of a MyPermutation instance.

To fix this, the _af_new method should use the class that's being instantiated, not the base Permutation class. So, instead of using Perm (which is Permutation), it should use the class that's being called. This can be achieved by using the cls parameter in a classmethod.

But since _af_new is a static method, it doesn't have access to the class instance. So, the solution is to make _af_new a classmethod, so that it can access the current class (cls) and use that to create the instance.

Alternatively, the code that calls _af_new should pass the current class, but that might be more involved.

Let me think. The current code uses Perm._af_new(a), where Perm is Permutation. So, if we change _af_new to be a classmethod, then Perm._af_new(a) would use Perm as the class, but if a subclass calls it, it would use the subclass.

Wait, but in the code, Perm is explicitly set to Permutation. For example, in the code:

p = Perm._af_new(a)

If Perm is Permutation, then even if the method is a classmethod, it would still create a Permutation instance. So, the problem is that Perm is hardcoded to Permutation.

So, the solution is to replace Perm with cls, but that would require changing how _af_new is called.

Alternatively, the _af_new method should be a classmethod that uses cls to create the instance.

Let me look at the code where _af_new is called. For example, in line 860:

return _af_new(list(range(size or 0)))

But _af_new is a static method of Permutation. So, when called as Perm._af_new(a), it's using the Permutation class. If we change _af_new to be a classmethod, then when called on a subclass, it would use the subclass.

But in the code, Perm is explicitly set to Permutation. For example, in the code:

Perm = Permutation

So, if we change _af_new to be a classmethod, then when called as Perm._af_new(a), it would still use Permutation, not the subclass.

Wait, but if the code is written as:

class MyPermutation(Permutation):
    pass

Then, when MyPermutation._af_new(a) is called, it would use MyPermutation as the class. But in the current code, Perm is set to Permutation, so when _af_new is called, it's using Perm, which is Permutation.

So, the problem is that Perm is hardcoded to Permutation. So, even if _af_new is a classmethod, when called as Perm._af_new(a), it will create a Permutation instance, not a MyPermutation instance.

Therefore, the solution is to replace Perm with cls in the code. But where is Perm defined?

Looking at the code, Perm is defined as:

Perm = Permutation

So, in the code, Perm is a reference to the Permutation class. So, any time Perm is used, it's creating a Permutation instance.

To fix this, we need to replace Perm with cls in the code. But how?

Alternatively, the code should use the current class (cls) when creating instances. So, instead of using Perm, it should use the class that's being instantiated.

But how is Perm being used? For example, in the code:

p = Perm._af_new(a)

If we change this to:

p = cls._af_new(a)

Then, when a subclass is used, cls would be the subclass, and _af_new would create an instance of the subclass.

But where is cls defined? In the __new__ method of the Permutation class, cls is the class being instantiated.

So, perhaps the solution is to modify the code that calls _af_new to use cls instead of Perm.

But where is Perm defined? Let's look for where Perm is assigned.

Looking through the code, I see:

Perm = Permutation

This is likely at the top of the file. So, Perm is a reference to the Permutation class. So, any time Perm is used, it's creating a Permutation instance.

So, the problem is that the code is using Perm to create instances, which is hardcoding the Permutation class. To allow subclassing, we need to use the current class (cls) instead of Perm.

But how is cls available in the code? For example, in the __new__ method of Permutation, cls is the class being instantiated. So, if we can replace Perm with cls in the code, then when a subclass is used, cls would be the subclass, and the instances would be created with the subclass.

But where is Perm used? Let's look for uses of Perm in the code.

================================================================================
LAST RESPONSE:
Okay, so the code defines Perm as Permutation at line 2830:

Perm = Permutation

Then, _af_new is assigned as Perm._af_new at line 2831:

_af_new = Perm._af_new

This means that _af_new is a static method of the Permutation class, and when called, it uses Perm (which is Permutation) to create instances. This is the root of the problem because when a subclass is used, Perm is still Permutation, so instances are created as Permutation, not the subclass.

To fix this, we need to replace Perm with cls in the code. However, since Perm is a global variable, changing it to cls would require modifying the code to use the current class (cls) instead of Perm.

But how can we do that? The _af_new method is a static method of Permutation, and when called via Perm._af_new, it's using the Permutation class. To make it use the current class (cls), we need to make _af_new a classmethod and use cls instead of Perm.

Let me look at the _af_new method:

@staticmethod
def _af_new(perm):
    """A method to produce a Permutation object from a list;
    the list is bound to the _array_form attribute, so it must
    not be modified; this method is meant for internal use only;
    the list ``a`` is supposed to be generated as a temporary value
    in a method, so p = Perm._af_new(a) is the only object
    to hold a reference to ``a``::
    """
    p = Basic.__new__(Perm, perm)
    p._array_form = perm
    p._size = len(perm)
    return p

The problem is that Perm is hardcoded here. So, when a subclass is used, Perm is still Permutation, so the instance is created as Permutation, not the subclass.

To fix this, we need to replace Perm with cls. But since _af_new is a static method, it doesn't have access to cls. So, the solution is to make _af_new a classmethod, so that it can access the current class (cls) and use that to create the instance.

Let's modify the _af_new method to be a classmethod:

@classmethod
def _af_new(cls, perm):
    p = Basic.__new__(cls, perm)
    p._array_form = perm
    p._size = len(perm)
    return p

This way, when called via Perm._af_new(a), it will use Perm as the class, and when called via a subclass's _af_new(a), it will use the subclass.

But where is _af_new called? For example, in the code:

p = Perm._af_new(a)

If we change _af_new to be a classmethod, then this would still use Perm (Permutation) as the class. So, the problem remains.

Wait, but if the code is written as:

p = cls._af_new(a)

Then, when a subclass is used, cls would be the subclass, and the instance would be created with the subclass.

But how is cls available in the code? For example, in the __new__ method of Permutation, cls is the class being instantiated.

So, perhaps the solution is to replace Perm with cls in the code where _af_new is called.

But where is Perm used? For example, in the code:

p = Perm._af_new(a)

If we can replace Perm with cls, then when a subclass is used, cls would be the subclass, and the instance would be created with the subclass.

But how to do that? The code that calls _af_new is inside the Permutation class's methods. For example, in the __new__ method:

def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    # ... some code ...
    return _af_new(aform)

But _af_new is a static method, so it's called as Perm._af_new(aform). If we change _af_new to be a classmethod, then it can be called as cls._af_new(aform), which would use the current class (cls).

So, the steps are:

1. Change _af_new to be a classmethod instead of a staticmethod.
2. Replace Perm with cls in the code where _af_new is called.

But where is _af_new called? Let's look for calls to _af_new in the code.

Looking through the code, _af_new is called in various places. For example:

- In the __new__ method of Permutation.
- In other methods like _af_pow, _af_invert, etc.

But since the code is quite large, it's better to search for calls to _af_new.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -n '_af_new' /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py</parameter>
