AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when using the __in lookup on a key transform for JSONField, it's not working as expected. The user noticed that using a filter with __in on a key in the JSONField returns zero results, but when using a direct key lookup, it returns the correct number of items. The goal is to make the __in lookup work properly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository. The uploaded directory is django__django__3.2, which is probably the Django 3.2 codebase. The issue is related to JSONField and how lookups are handled for key transforms, especially with the __in operator.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository to find where JSONField is defined and how lookups are handled. JSONField is part of Django's contrib.postgres module, but since the user is moving from django_mysql.models.JSONField to Django's built-in JSONField, I need to check if there are differences in how lookups are implemented.\n\nThe problem seems to be with the __in lookup on a key transform. For example, when filtering with 'our_field__key__in': [0], it's not returning the expected results, but 'our_field__key': 0 does. So, the issue is likely in how the __in lookup is translated into SQL for JSONField key transforms.\n\nI should look into the Django source code for JSONField and the lookup classes that handle key transforms. Specifically, I need to check how the __in lookup is implemented for JSONField and whether there's a bug in the key transform handling.\n\nFirst, I'll navigate to the Django repository and find the JSONField implementation. In Django 3.2, JSONField is in django/db/models/fields/json.py. Let me check that file.\n\nI need to see how lookups are defined for JSONField. JSONField uses the KeyTransform class for key lookups, and then the __in lookup is applied on top of that. The problem might be in how the KeyTransform is combined with the __in lookup.\n\nLooking at the KeyTransform class, it's part of the lookups module. The KeyTransform is a Transform that allows accessing a specific key in the JSON object. Then, when an __in lookup is applied, it should generate the appropriate SQL.\n\nIn Django, the __in lookup is handled by the In lookup class. So, when you do 'our_field__key__in', it's a combination of KeyTransform and In lookup. The issue might be in how the SQL is generated for this combination.\n\nLet me think about the SQL that should be generated. For example, if the JSONField is stored as a JSONB field in PostgreSQL, the query for 'our_field__key__in': [0] should translate to something like:\n\nSELECT ... WHERE (our_field -> 'key') IN (0)\n\nBut if the JSONField is stored as a text field in MySQL or SQLite, the query might be different, perhaps using JSON_EXTRACT or similar functions.\n\nThe problem might be that the KeyTransform is not properly converting the key into the correct SQL expression, or the In lookup is not handling the transformed expression correctly.\n\nTo reproduce the error, I need to create a test case. The user provided a scenario where a filter with __in on a key transform returns zero results, but a direct key lookup returns 312. So, I need to create a model with a JSONField, insert some data, and then run these two filters to see the discrepancy.\n\nI should create a script that sets up a Django project, creates a model with a JSONField, inserts some data, and then runs the two filters to demonstrate the issue. Then, after making the necessary changes, run the script again to confirm the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the JSONField is defined and how the lookups are implemented. Let's start by looking into the django/db/models/fields/json.py file.\n\nIn Django 3.2, JSONField is defined as a subclass of Field. It uses the KeyTransform class for key lookups. The KeyTransform is part of the lookups module, which is in django/db/models/lookups.py.\n\nWait, no. The KeyTransform is actually part of the lookups module in the postgres package. Because JSONField is part of the postgres contrib module. Wait, no, in Django 3.2, JSONField is available in the main models module, not just the postgres contrib. Let me check the code.\n\nLooking at django/db/models/fields/json.py in Django 3.2, the JSONField is defined here. It uses the KeyTransform class from django.db.models.lookups. But the KeyTransform is actually part of the lookups module.\n\nWait, perhaps the KeyTransform is defined in django/db/models/lookups.py. Let me check.\n\nIn django/db/models/lookups.py, there's a class called KeyTransform. Yes, that's the one. The KeyTransform is a Transform that allows accessing a key in a JSONField. Then, when an __in lookup is applied, it's combined with the KeyTransform.\n\nSo, the problem is likely in how the KeyTransform is being used with the In lookup. The In lookup expects a list of values, and the KeyTransform provides the transformed expression. The SQL generated should compare the transformed key to each value in the list.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in how the parameters are passed to the SQL query. For example, in MySQL, the JSON_EXTRACT function is used, and the parameters might need to be properly formatted.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a bug in how the KeyTransform is being combined with the In lookup. For example, the In lookup might be expecting a different type of expression.\n\nTo debug this, I need to see the SQL generated for both the __in and the direct key lookup. That will help identify where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Explore the Django codebase to find where JSONField and KeyTransform are defined.\n2. Create a test script that sets up a model, inserts data, and runs the two filters to reproduce the issue.\n3. Analyze the generated SQL for both filters to see the difference.\n4. Identify the part of the code that is generating incorrect SQL and fix it.\n5. Test the fix with the script to ensure it works.\n\nFirst, let's create the test script. I'll need to create a Django project, a model with a JSONField, insert some data, and then run the two filters.\n\nBut since I'm working in the Django codebase, I need to make sure that the changes are made in the correct place. The issue is that the __in lookup on a key transform isn't working as expected. So, the fix likely involves modifying the KeyTransform or the In lookup to handle this case correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the database backend's implementation of the JSONField lookups. For example, in MySQL, the JSON_EXTRACT function is used, and the parameters might not be properly formatted for the __in lookup.\n\nLet me start by creating a simple Django project to reproduce the issue.\n\nBut since I'm in the Django codebase, I can create a script that uses the Django models and runs the necessary code.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a Django project. Let's create a new app and a model with a JSONField.\n\nHere's a sample script:\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models import Q\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nsettings.configure(\n    DEBUG=True,\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': 'test.db',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'myapp',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\ndjango.setup()\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    data = models.JSONField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'myapp'\n\nMyModel.objects.all().delete()\n\n# Insert some data\nfor i in range(10):\n    MyModel.objects.create(data={'key': i})\n\n# Test the filters\nfirst_filter = {'data__key__in': [0, 1, 2]}\nfirst_items = MyModel.objects.filter(**first_filter)\nprint(f\"First filter count: {first_items.count()}\")\n\nsecond_filter = {'data__key': 0}\nsecond_items = MyModel.objects.filter(**second_filter)\nprint(f\"Second filter count: {second_items.count()}\")\n```\n\nThis script sets up a Django project with a simple model, inserts 10 entries with 'key' values from 0 to 9, and then runs the two filters. On a working setup, the first filter should return 3 items (0, 1, 2), and the second should return 1 item. But according to the issue description, the first filter returns 0, which is the problem.\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the second filter returns 312 items, but the first returns 0. So, perhaps the data in their model has multiple entries with the same key value. In the example script, inserting 10 entries with unique keys would result in the first filter returning 3 items. But in the user's case, the second filter returns 312, which suggests that many entries have the key set to 0.\n\nSo, the script I wrote is a simplified version. The key point is that the __in filter is not working as expected.\n\nNow, I need to run this script in the Django 3.2 environment to see if the issue reproduces. If it does, then the problem is in the Django code.

So, the problem is that when using the __in lookup on a key transform for JSONField, it's not working as expected. The user noticed that using a filter with __in on a key in the JSONField returns zero results, but when using a direct key lookup, it returns the correct number of items. The goal is to make the __in lookup work properly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository. The uploaded directory is django__django__3.2, which is probably the Django 3.2 codebase. The issue is related to JSONField and how lookups are handled for key transforms, especially with the __in operator.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository to find where JSONField is defined and how lookups are handled. JSONField is part of Django's contrib.postgres module, but since the user is moving from django_mysql.models.JSONField to Django's built-in JSONField, I need to check if there are differences in how lookups are implemented.\n\nThe problem seems to be with the __in lookup on a key transform. For example, when filtering with 'our_field__key__in': [0], it's not returning the expected results, but 'our_field__key': 0 does. So, the issue is likely in how the __in lookup is translated into SQL for JSONField key transforms.\n\nI should look into the Django source code for JSONField and the lookup classes that handle key transforms. Specifically, I need to check how the __in lookup is implemented for JSONField and whether there's a bug in the key transform handling.\n\nFirst, I'll navigate to the Django repository and find the JSONField implementation. In Django 3.2, JSONField is in django/db/models/fields/json.py. Let me check that file.\n\nI need to see how lookups are defined for JSONField. JSONField uses the KeyTransform class for key lookups, and then the __in lookup is applied on top of that. The problem might be in how the KeyTransform is combined with the __in lookup.\n\nLooking at the KeyTransform class, it's part of the lookups module. The KeyTransform is a Transform that allows accessing a specific key in the JSON object. Then, when an __in lookup is applied, it should generate the appropriate SQL.\n\nIn Django, the __in lookup is handled by the In lookup class. So, when you do 'our_field__key__in', it's a combination of KeyTransform and In lookup. The issue might be in how the SQL is generated for this combination.\n\nLet me think about the SQL that should be generated. For example, if the JSONField is stored as a JSONB field in PostgreSQL, the query for 'our_field__key__in': [0] should translate to something like:\n\nSELECT ... WHERE (our_field -> 'key') IN (0)\n\nBut if the JSONField is stored as a text field in MySQL or SQLite, the query might be different, perhaps using JSON_EXTRACT or similar functions.\n\nThe problem might be that the KeyTransform is not properly converting the key into the correct SQL expression, or the In lookup is not handling the transformed expression correctly.\n\nTo reproduce the error, I need to create a test case. The user provided a scenario where a filter with __in on a key transform returns zero results, but a direct key lookup returns 312. So, I need to create a model with a JSONField, insert some data, and then run these two filters to see the discrepancy.\n\nI should create a script that sets up a Django project, creates a model with a JSONField, inserts some data, and then runs the two filters to demonstrate the issue. Then, after making the necessary changes, run the script again to confirm the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the JSONField is defined and how the lookups are implemented. Let's start by looking into the django/db/models/fields/json.py file.\n\nIn Django 3.2, JSONField is defined as a subclass of Field. It uses the KeyTransform class for key lookups. The KeyTransform is part of the lookups module, which is in django/db/models/lookups.py.\n\nWait, no. The KeyTransform is actually part of the lookups module in the postgres package. Because JSONField is part of the postgres contrib module. Wait, no, in Django 3.2, JSONField is available in the main models module, not just the postgres contrib. Let me check the code.\n\nLooking at django/db/models/fields/json.py in Django 3.2, the JSONField is defined here. It uses the KeyTransform class from django.db.models.lookups. But the KeyTransform is actually part of the lookups module.\n\nWait, perhaps the KeyTransform is defined in django/db/models/lookups.py. Let me check.\n\nIn django/db/models/lookups.py, there's a class called KeyTransform. Yes, that's the one. The KeyTransform is a Transform that allows accessing a key in a JSONField. Then, when an __in lookup is applied, it's combined with the KeyTransform.\n\nSo, the problem is likely in how the KeyTransform is being used with the In lookup. The In lookup expects a list of values, and the KeyTransform provides the transformed expression. The SQL generated should compare the transformed key to each value in the list.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in how the parameters are passed to the SQL query. For example, in MySQL, the JSON_EXTRACT function is used, and the parameters might need to be properly formatted.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a bug in how the KeyTransform is being combined with the In lookup. For example, the In lookup might be expecting a different type of expression.\n\nTo debug this, I need to see the SQL generated for both the __in and the direct key lookup. That will help identify where the problem lies.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Explore the Django codebase to find where JSONField and KeyTransform are defined.\n2. Create a test script that sets up a model, inserts data, and runs the two filters to reproduce the issue.\n3. Analyze the generated SQL for both filters to see the difference.\n4. Identify the part of the code that is generating incorrect SQL and fix it.\n5. Test the fix with the script to ensure it works.\n\nFirst, let's create the test script. I'll need to create a Django project, a model with a JSONField, insert some data, and then run the two filters.\n\nBut since I'm working in the Django codebase, I need to make sure that the changes are made in the correct place. The issue is that the __in lookup on a key transform isn't working as expected. So, the fix likely involves modifying the KeyTransform or the In lookup to handle this case correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the database backend's implementation of the JSONField lookups. For example, in MySQL, the JSON_EXTRACT function is used, and the parameters might not be properly formatted for the __in lookup.\n\nLet me start by creating a simple Django project to reproduce the issue.\n\nBut since I'm in the Django codebase, I can create a script that uses the Django models and runs the necessary code.\n\nFirst, I need to set up a Django project. Let's create a new app and a model with a JSONField.\n\nHere's a sample script:\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models import Q\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nsettings.configure(\n    DEBUG=True,\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': 'test.db',\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=[\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'myapp',\n    ],\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\ndjango.setup()\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    data = models.JSONField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'myapp'\n\nMyModel.objects.all().delete()\n\n# Insert some data\nfor i in range(10):\n    MyModel.objects.create(data={'key': i})\n\n# Test the filters\nfirst_filter = {'data__key__in': [0, 1, 2]}\nfirst_items = MyModel.objects.filter(**first_filter)\nprint(f\"First filter count: {first_items.count()}\")\n\nsecond_filter = {'data__key': 0}\nsecond_items = MyModel.objects.filter(**second_filter)\nprint(f\"Second filter count: {second_items.count()}\")\n```\n\nThis script sets up a Django project with a simple model, inserts 10 entries with 'key' values from 0 to 9, and then runs the two filters. On a working setup, the first filter should return 3 items (0, 1, 2), and the second should return 1 item. But according to the issue description, the first filter returns 0, which is the problem.\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the second filter returns 312 items, but the first returns 0. So, perhaps the data in their model has multiple entries with the same key value. In the example script, inserting 10 entries with unique keys would result in the first filter returning 3 items. But in the user's case, the second filter returns 312, which suggests that many entries have the key set to 0.\n\nSo, the script I wrote is a simplified version. The key point is that the __in filter is not working as expected.\n\nNow, I need to run this script in the Django 3.2 environment to see if the issue reproduces. If it does, then the problem is in the Django code. If not, then perhaps the issue is specific to certain database backends, like MySQL or Oracle.\n\nBut since the user mentioned that the problem occurs on MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite, it's likely a general issue with the Django code.\n\nSo, let's proceed to create this script and run it.\n\nFirst, I need to create a file, say, test_jsonfield.py, and write the above code into it. Then, run it using python test_jsonfield.py.\n\nBut since I'm in the Django codebase, I need to make sure that the script can be executed.
