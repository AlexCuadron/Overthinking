The bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir. The linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious, but what I don't understand is why it only fails during test db setup, not during repl or script use. I wish I could help more and come up with a real solution. Hopefully, this is enough for someone wiser to find the culprit.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue in a Django repository. The problem is about ordering a parent model in multi-table inheritance when `Meta.ordering` contains expressions. The PR description mentions that there's a crash, and it only happens during test database setup, not in the REPL or script use. The user has already set up the test files, so I don't need to touch those; I just need to make minimal changes to the non-test files to resolve the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the repository. Since it's Django 3.0, I should be familiar with that version, but it's always good to double-check. Multi-table inheritance in Django can be tricky, especially with ordering and expressions.\n\nI should start by exploring the repository to see how the models are defined and where the ordering is specified. Probably, there's a parent model with `Meta.ordering` set to some expression, and when trying to order by that in a query, it's causing a crash during test database setup.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I need to reproduce the error first. The user mentioned that there's a reproducible test repository linked in the PR description, but since I have the code in `/workspace/django__django__3.0`, I should be able to run tests or scripts there.\n\nI need to find the script that reproduces the error. Maybe there's a specific test file or a script provided in the repository that demonstrates the issue. Once I can reproduce the error, I can then try to understand why it's happening and fix it.\n\nLet me assume that there's a model defined something like this:\n\n```python\nclass ParentModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    some_field = models.IntegerField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = ['some_expression']\n\nclass ChildModel(ParentModel):\n    extra_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n```\n\nAnd perhaps `some_expression` is an F expression or some other query expression.\n\nFirst, I need to find where `Meta.ordering` is using an expression. I should search for model classes where `ordering` is set to something other than field names, maybe using F expressions or other query expressions.\n\nOnce I find that, I need to see how ordering is being applied in queries, especially in the context of multi-table inheritance.\n\nThe error only occurs during test database setup, which is strange. Maybe there's something different about how the test database is set up compared to a regular database.\n\nI should look into Django's test runner and see how it sets up the test database. Perhaps there are differences in migrations or initial data that cause this issue.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Explore the repository to understand the model structure and where `Meta.ordering` is defined with expressions.\n\n2. Find or create a script that reproduces the error. Run it using BashTool to confirm the error.\n\n3. Analyze why the error occurs only during test database setup.\n\n4. Make minimal changes to fix the issue, ensuring that it doesn't break regular usage.\n\n5. Rerun the script to confirm the error is fixed.\n\n6. Consider edge cases to ensure the fix is robust.\n\nStarting with step 1, I need to explore the repository. Since I have access to the file system, I can list the contents of `/workspace/django__django__3.0` to see what's inside.\n\nI'll use the `execute_bash` function to list the directory contents.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__3.0</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\nAUTHORS  CONTRIBUTING.rst  Django.egg-info  FUNDING.yml  Gruntfile.js  INSTALL  LICENSE  LICENSE.python  MANIFEST.in  README.rst  django  docs  extras  js_tests  package.json  scripts  setup.cfg  setup.py  tests  tox.ini\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so the repository contains various files and directories related to Django.

The user said not to modify test files, but I can look at them to understand the problem.\n\nAssuming that the test files are in `tests/`, I can look for model definitions there.\n\nLet me list the contents of `tests/`:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__3.0/tests</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\nREADME.rst              admin_custom_urls   admin_ordering      admin_widgets        apps        base             cache                   context_processors  custom_methods               datetimes     decorators      deprecation         expressions           field_defaults     filtered_relation       force_insert_update   generic_relations          get_or_create   i18n                  introspection          m2m_and_m2o       m2m_signals          managers_regress  messages_tests                   migrations      model_formsets_regress     model_options      mutually_referential  null_queries           pagination        proxy_model_inheritance  redirects_tests  responses          select_for_update        servers         signals               sites_tests        syndication_tests  test_client          test_sqlite.py     unmanaged_models     urls.py        version\nabsolute_url_overrides  admin_default_site  admin_registration  aggregation          asgi        bash_completion  check_framework         csrf_tests          custom_migration_operations  db_functions  defer           dispatch            expressions_case      field_subclassing  fixtures                foreign_object        generic_relations_regress  gis_tests       import_error_package  invalid_models_tests   m2m_intermediary  m2m_through          many_to_many      middleware                       migrations2     model_indexes              model_package      nested_foreign_keys   one_to_one             postgres_tests    proxy_models             requests         reverse_lookup     select_related           sessions_tests  signed_cookies_tests  staticfiles_tests  template_backends  test_client_regress  test_utils         update               user_commands  view_tests\nadmin_autodiscover      admin_docs          admin_scripts       aggregation_regress  async       basic            conditional_processing  custom_columns      custom_pk                    db_typecasts  defer_regress   distinct_on_fields  expressions_window    file_storage       fixtures_model_package  forms_tests           generic_views              handlers        indexes               known_related_objects  m2m_multiple      m2m_through_regress  many_to_one       middleware_exceptions            model_fields    model_inheritance          model_regress      no_models             or_lookups             prefetch_related  queries                  requirements     runtests.py        select_related_onetoone  settings_tests  signing               str                template_loader    test_exceptions      timezones          update_only_fields   utils_tests    wsgi\nadmin_changelist        admin_filters       admin_utils         annotations          auth_tests  builtin_server   constraints             custom_lookups      datatypes                    db_utils      delete          empty               extra_regress         file_uploads       fixtures_regress        from_db_value         get_earliest_or_latest     httpwrappers    inline_formsets       logging_tests          m2m_recursive     m2o_recursive        many_to_one_null  migrate_signals                  model_forms     model_inheritance_regress  modeladmin         null_fk               order_with_respect_to  project_template  queryset_pickle          reserved_names   save_delete_hooks  select_related_regress   shell           sitemaps_tests        string_lookup      template_tests     test_runner          transaction_hooks  urlpatterns          validation\nadmin_checks            admin_inlines       admin_views         app_loading          backends    bulk_create      contenttypes_tests      custom_managers     dates                        dbshell       delete_regress  empty_models        field_deconstruction  files              flatpages_tests         generic_inline_admin  get_object_or_404          humanize_tests  inspectdb             lookup                 m2m_regress       mail                 max_lengths       migration_test_data_persistence  model_formsets  model_meta                 multiple_database  null_fk_ordering      ordering               properties        raw_query                resolve_url      schema             serializers              shortcuts       sites_framework       swappable_models   templates          test_runner_apps     transactions       urlpatterns_reverse  validators\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, there are a lot of test directories and files in `tests/`.

A model's\ndatabase table name is constructed by joining the model's \"app label\" -- the\nname you used in :djadmin:`manage.py startapp <startapp>` -- to the model's\nclass name, with an underscore between them.\n\nFor example, if you have an app ``bookstore`` (as created by\n``manage.py startapp bookstore``), a model defined as ``class Book`` will have\na database table named ``bookstore_book``.\n\nTo override the database table name, use the ``db_table`` parameter in\n``class Meta``.\n\nIf your database table name is an SQL reserved word, or contains characters that\naren't allowed in Python variable names -- notably, the hyphen -- that's OK.\nDjango quotes column and table names behind the scenes.\n\n.. admonition:: Use lowercase table names for MariaDB and MySQL\n\n    It is strongly advised that you use lowercase table names when you override\n    the table name via ``db_table``, particularly if you are using the MySQL\n    backend. See the :ref:`MySQL notes <mysql-notes>` for more details.\n\n.. admonition:: Table name quoting for Oracle\n\n   In order to meet the 30-char limitation Oracle has on table names,\n   and match the usual conventions for Oracle databases, Django may shorten\n   table names and turn them all-uppercase. To prevent such transformations,\n   use a quoted name as the value for ``db_table``::\n\n       db_table = '\"name_left_in_lowercase\"'\n\n   Such quoted names can also be used with Django's other supported database\n   backends; except for Oracle, however, the quotes have no effect. See the\n   :ref:`Oracle notes <oracle-notes>` for more details.\n\n``db_tablespace``\n-----------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.db_tablespace\n\n    The name of the :doc:`database tablespace </topics/db/tablespaces>` to use\n    for this model. The default is the project's :setting:`DEFAULT_TABLESPACE`\n    setting, if set. If the backend doesn't support tablespaces, this option is\n    ignored.\n\n``default_manager_name``\n------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.default_manager_name\n\n    The name of the manager to use for the model's\n    :attr:`~django.db.models.Model._default_manager`.\n\n``default_related_name``\n------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.default_related_name\n\n    The name that will be used by default for the relation from a related object\n    back to this one. The default is ``<model_name>_set``.\n\n    This option also sets :attr:`~ForeignKey.related_query_name`.\n\n    As the reverse name for a field should be unique, be careful if you intend\n    to subclass your model. To work around name collisions, part of the name\n    should contain ``'%(app_label)s'`` and ``'%(model_name)s'``, which are\n    replaced respectively by the name of the application the model is in,\n    and the name of the model, both lowercased. See the paragraph on\n    :ref:`related names for abstract models <abstract-related-name>`.\n\n``get_latest_by``\n-----------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.get_latest_by\n\n    The name of a field or a list of field names in the model, typically\n    :class:`DateField`, :class:`DateTimeField`, or :class:`IntegerField`. This\n    specifies the default field(s) to use in your model :class:`Manager`\u2019s\n    :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` and\n    :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.earliest` methods.\n\n    Example::\n\n        # Latest by ascending order_date.\n        get_latest_by = \"order_date\"\n\n        # Latest by priority descending, order_date ascending.\n        get_latest_by = ['-priority', 'order_date']\n\n    See the :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` docs for more.\n\n``managed``\n-----------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.managed\n\n    Defaults to ``True``, meaning Django will create the appropriate database\n    tables in :djadmin:`migrate` or as part of migrations and remove them as\n    part of a :djadmin:`flush` management command. That is, Django\n    *manages* the database tables' lifecycles.\n\n    If ``False``, no database table creation or deletion operations will be\n    performed for this model. This is useful if the model represents an existing\n    table or a database view that has been created by some other means. This is\n    the *only* difference when ``managed=False``. All other aspects of\n    model handling are exactly the same as normal. This includes\n\n    #. Adding an automatic primary key field to the model if you don't\n       declare it.  To avoid confusion for later code readers, it's\n       recommended to specify all the columns from the database table you\n       are modeling when using unmanaged models.\n\n    #. If a model with ``managed=False`` contains a\n       :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` that points to another\n       unmanaged model, then the intermediate table for the many-to-many\n       join will also not be created. However, the intermediary table\n       between one managed and one unmanaged model *will* be created.\n\n       If you need to change this default behavior, create the intermediary\n       table as an explicit model (with ``managed`` set as needed) and use\n       the :attr:`ManyToManyField.through` attribute to make the relation\n       use your custom model.\n\n    For tests involving models with ``managed=False``, it's up to you to ensure\n    the correct tables are created as part of the test setup.\n\n    If you're interested in changing the Python-level behavior of a model class,\n    you *could* use ``managed=False`` and create a copy of an existing model.\n    However, there's a better approach for that situation: :ref:`proxy-models`.\n\n``order_with_respect_to``\n-------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.order_with_respect_to\n\n    Makes this object orderable with respect to the given field, usually a\n    ``ForeignKey``. This can be used to make related objects orderable with\n    respect to a parent object. For example, if an ``Answer`` relates to a\n    ``Question`` object, and a question has more than one answer, and the order\n    of answers matters, you'd do this::\n\n        from django.db import models\n\n        class Question(models.Model):\n            text = models.TextField()\n            # ...\n\n        class Answer(models.Model):\n            question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n            # ...\n\n            class Meta:\n                order_with_respect_to = 'question'\n\n    When ``order_with_respect_to`` is set, two additional methods are provided to\n    retrieve and to set the order of the related objects: ``get_RELATED_order()``\n    and ``set_RELATED_order()``, where ``RELATED`` is the lowercased model name. For\n    example, assuming that a ``Question`` object has multiple related ``Answer``\n    objects, the list returned contains the primary keys of the related ``Answer``\n    objects::\n\n        >>> question = Question.objects.get(id=1)\n        >>> question.get_answer_order()\n        [1, 2, 3]\n\n    The order of a ``Question`` object's related ``Answer`` objects can be set by\n    passing in a list of ``Answer`` primary keys::\n\n        >>> question.set_answer_order([3, 1, 2])\n\n    The related objects also get two methods, ``get_next_in_order()`` and\n    ``get_previous_in_order()``, which can be used to access those objects in their\n    proper order. Assuming the ``Answer`` objects are ordered by ``id``::\n\n        >>> answer = Answer.objects.get(id=2)\n        >>> answer.get_next_in_order()\n        <Answer: 3>\n        >>> answer.get_previous_in_order()\n        <Answer: 1>\n\n.. admonition:: ``order_with_respect_to`` implicitly sets the ``ordering`` option\n\n    Internally, ``order_with_respect_to`` adds an additional field/database\n    column named ``_order`` and sets the model's :attr:`~Options.ordering`\n    option to this field. Consequently, ``order_with_respect_to`` and\n    ``ordering`` cannot be used together, and the ordering added by\n    ``order_with_respect_to`` will apply whenever you obtain a list of objects\n    of this model.\n\n.. admonition:: Changing ``order_with_respect_to``\n\n    Because ``order_with_respect_to`` adds a new database column, be sure to\n    make and apply the appropriate migrations if you add or change\n    ``order_with_respect_to`` after your initial :djadmin:`migrate`.\n\n``ordering``\n------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.ordering\n\n    The default ordering for the object, for use when obtaining lists of objects::\n\n        ordering = ['-order_date']\n\n    This is a tuple or list of strings and/or query expressions. Each string is\n    a field name with an optional \"-\" prefix, which indicates descending order.\n    Fields without a leading \"-\" will be ordered ascending. Use the string \"?\"\n    to order randomly.\n\n    For example, to order by a ``pub_date`` field ascending, use this::\n\n        ordering = ['pub_date']\n\n    To order by ``pub_date`` descending, use this::\n\n        ordering = ['-pub_date']\n\n    To order by ``pub_date`` descending, then by ``author`` ascending, use this::\n\n        ordering = ['-pub_date', 'author']\n\n    You can also use :doc:`query expressions </ref/models/expressions>`. To\n    order by ``author`` ascending and make null values sort last, use this::\n\n        from django.db.models import F\n\n        ordering = [F('author').asc(nulls_last=True)]\n\n    Default ordering also affects :ref:`aggregation queries\n    <aggregation-ordering-interaction>` but this won't be the case starting\n    in Django 3.1.\n\n.. warning::\n\n    Ordering is not a free operation. Each field you add to the ordering\n    incurs a cost to your database. Each foreign key you add will\n    implicitly include all of its default orderings as well.\n\n    If a query doesn't have an ordering specified, results are returned from\n    the database in an unspecified order. A particular ordering is guaranteed\n    only when ordering by a set of fields that uniquely identify each object in\n    the results. For example, if a ``name`` field isn't unique, ordering by it\n    won't guarantee objects with the same name always appear in the same order.\n\n``permissions``\n---------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.permissions\n\n    Extra permissions to enter into the permissions table when creating this object.\n    Add, change, delete, and view permissions are automatically created for each\n    model. This example specifies an extra permission, ``can_deliver_pizzas``::\n\n        permissions = [('can_deliver_pizzas', 'Can deliver pizzas')]\n\n    This is a list or tuple of 2-tuples in the format ``(permission_code,\n    human_readable_permission_name)``.\n\n``default_permissions``\n-----------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.default_permissions\n\n    Defaults to ``('add', 'change', 'delete', 'view')``. You may customize this\n    list, for example, by setting this to an empty list if your app doesn't\n    require any of the default permissions. It must be specified on the model\n    before the model is created by :djadmin:`migrate` in order to prevent any\n    omitted permissions from being created.\n\n``proxy``\n---------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.proxy\n\n    If ``proxy = True``, a model which subclasses another model will be treated as\n    a :ref:`proxy model <proxy-models>`.\n\n``required_db_features``\n------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.required_db_features\n\n    List of database features that the current connection should have so that\n    the model is considered during the migration phase. For example, if you set\n    this list to ``['gis_enabled']``, the model will only be synchronized on\n    GIS-enabled databases. It's also useful to skip some models when testing\n    with several database backends. Avoid relations between models that may or\n    may not be created as the ORM doesn't handle this.\n\n``required_db_vendor``\n----------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.required_db_vendor\n\n    Name of a supported database vendor that this model is specific to. Current\n    built-in vendor names are: ``sqlite``, ``postgresql``, ``mysql``,\n    ``oracle``. If this attribute is not empty and the current connection vendor\n    doesn't match it, the model will not be synchronized.\n\n``select_on_save``\n------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.select_on_save\n\n    Determines if Django will use the pre-1.6\n    :meth:`django.db.models.Model.save()` algorithm. The old algorithm\n    uses ``SELECT`` to determine if there is an existing row to be updated.\n    The new algorithm tries an ``UPDATE`` directly. In some rare cases the\n    ``UPDATE`` of an existing row isn't visible to Django. An example is the\n    PostgreSQL ``ON UPDATE`` trigger which returns ``NULL``. In such cases the\n    new algorithm will end up doing an ``INSERT`` even when a row exists in\n    the database.\n\n    Usually there is no need to set this attribute. The default is\n    ``False``.\n\n    See :meth:`django.db.models.Model.save()` for more about the old and\n    new saving algorithm.\n\n``indexes``\n-----------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.indexes\n\n    A list of :doc:`indexes </ref/models/indexes>` that you want to define on\n    the model::\n\n        from django.db import models\n\n        class Customer(models.Model):\n            first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n            last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n            class Meta:\n                indexes = [\n                    models.Index(fields=['last_name', 'first_name']),\n                    models.Index(fields=['first_name'], name='first_name_idx'),\n                ]\n\n``unique_together``\n-------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.unique_together\n\n    .. admonition:: Use :class:`.UniqueConstraint` with the :attr:`~Options.constraints` option instead.\n\n        :class:`.UniqueConstraint` provides more functionality than\n        ``unique_together``. ``unique_together`` may be deprecated in the\n        future.\n\n    Sets of field names that, taken together, must be unique::\n\n        unique_together = [['driver', 'restaurant']]\n\n    This is a list of lists that must be unique when considered together.\n    It's used in the Django admin and is enforced at the database level (i.e., the\n    appropriate ``UNIQUE`` statements are included in the ``CREATE TABLE``\n    statement).\n\n    For convenience, ``unique_together`` can be a single list when dealing with\n    a single set of fields::\n\n        unique_together = ['driver', 'restaurant']\n\n    A :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` cannot be included in\n    unique_together. (It's not clear what that would even mean!) If you\n    need to validate uniqueness related to a\n    :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField`, try using a signal or\n    an explicit :attr:`through <ManyToManyField.through>` model.\n\n    The ``ValidationError`` raised during model validation when the constraint\n    is violated has the ``unique_together`` error code.\n\n``index_together``\n------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.index_together\n\n    .. admonition:: Use the :attr:`~Options.indexes` option instead.\n\n        The newer :attr:`~Options.indexes` option provides more functionality\n        than ``index_together``. ``index_together`` may be deprecated in the\n        future.\n\n    Sets of field names that, taken together, are indexed::\n\n        index_together = [\n            [\"pub_date\", \"deadline\"],\n        ]\n\n    This list of fields will be indexed together (i.e. the appropriate\n    ``CREATE INDEX`` statement will be issued.)\n\n    For convenience, ``index_together`` can be a single list when dealing with a single\n    set of fields::\n\n        index_together = [\"pub_date\", \"deadline\"]\n\n``constraints``\n---------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.constraints\n\n    .. versionadded:: 2.2\n\n    A list of :doc:`constraints </ref/models/constraints>` that you want to\n    define on the model::\n\n        from django.db import models\n\n        class Customer(models.Model):\n            age = models.IntegerField()\n\n            class Meta:\n                constraints = [\n                    models.CheckConstraint(check=models.Q(age__gte=18), name='age_gte_18'),\n                ]\n\n``verbose_name``\n----------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.verbose_name\n\n    A human-readable name for the object, singular::\n\n        verbose_name = \"pizza\"\n\n    If this isn't given, Django will use a munged version of the class name:\n    ``CamelCase`` becomes ``camel case``.\n\n``verbose_name_plural``\n-----------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.verbose_name_plural\n\n    The plural name for the object::\n\n        verbose_name_plural = \"stories\"\n\n    If this isn't given, Django will use :attr:`~Options.verbose_name` + ``\"s\"``.\n\nRead-only ``Meta`` attributes\n=============================\n\n``label``\n---------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.label\n\n    Representation of the object, returns ``app_label.object_name``, e.g.\n    ``'polls.Question'``.\n\n``label_lower``\n---------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.label_lower\n\n    Representation of the model, returns ``app_label.model_name``, e.g.\n    ``'polls.question'``.\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so from the documentation, `Meta.ordering` can accept a list of strings or query expressions.

You can find the full write up as well as reproducible test repository \u200bhttps://github.com/JonnyWaffles/djangoordermetabug. The bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir. The linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious, but what I don't understand is why it only fails during test db setup, not during repl or script use. I wish I could help more and come up with a real solution. Hopefully, this is enough for someone wiser to find the culprit.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem is about ordering a parent model in multi-table inheritance when `Meta.ordering` contains expressions. The PR description mentions that there's a crash, and it only happens during test database setup, not in the REPL or script use. The user has already set up the test files, so I don't need to touch those; I just need to make minimal changes to the non-test files to resolve the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the repository. Since it's Django 3.0, I should be familiar with that version, but it's always good to double-check. Multi-table inheritance in Django can be tricky, especially with ordering and expressions.\n\nI should start by exploring the repository to see how the models are defined and where the ordering is specified. Probably, there's a parent model with `Meta.ordering` set to some expression, and when trying to order by that in a query, it's causing a crash during test database setup.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I need to reproduce the error first. The user mentioned that there's a reproducible test repository linked in the PR description, but since I have the code in `/workspace/django__django__3.0`, I should be able to run tests or scripts there.\n\nI need to find the script that reproduces the error. Maybe there's a specific test file or a script provided in the repository that demonstrates the issue. Once I can reproduce the error, I can then try to understand why it's happening and fix it.\n\nLet me assume that there's a model defined something like this:\n\n```python\nclass ParentModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    some_field = models.IntegerField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = ['some_expression']\n\nclass ChildModel(ParentModel):\n    extra_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n```\n\nAnd perhaps `some_expression` is an F expression or some other query expression.\n\nFirst, I need to find where `Meta.ordering` is using an expression. I should search for model classes where `ordering` is set to something other than field names, maybe using F expressions or other query expressions.\n\nOnce I find that, I need to see how ordering is being applied in queries, especially in the context of multi-table inheritance.\n\nThe error only occurs during test database setup, which is strange. Maybe there's something different about how the test database is set up compared to a regular database.\n\nI should look into Django's test runner and see how it sets up the test database. Perhaps there are differences in migrations or initial data that cause this issue.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Explore the repository to understand the model structure and where `Meta.ordering` is defined with expressions.\n\n2. Find or create a script that reproduces the error. Run it using BashTool to confirm the error.\n\n3. Analyze why the error occurs only during test database setup.\n\n4. Make minimal changes to fix the issue, ensuring that it doesn't break regular usage.\n\n5. Rerun the script to confirm the error is fixed.\n\n6. Consider edge cases to ensure the fix is robust.\n\nStarting with step 1, I need to explore the repository.

A model's\ndatabase table name is constructed by joining the model's \"app label\" -- the\nname you used in :djadmin:`manage.py startapp <startapp>` -- to the model's\nclass name, with an underscore between them.\n\nFor example, if you have an app ``bookstore`` (as created by\n``manage.py startapp bookstore``), a model defined as ``class Book`` will have\na database table named ``bookstore_book``.\n\nTo override the database table name, use the ``db_table`` parameter in\n``class Meta``.\n\nIf your database table name is an SQL reserved word, or contains characters that\naren't allowed in Python variable names -- notably, the hyphen -- that's OK.\nDjango quotes column and table names behind the scenes.\n\n.. admonition:: Use lowercase table names for MariaDB and MySQL\n\n    It is strongly advised that you use lowercase table names when you override\n    the table name via ``db_table``, particularly if you are using the MySQL\n    backend. See the :ref:`MySQL notes <mysql-notes>` for more details.\n\n.. admonition:: Table name quoting for Oracle\n\n   In order to meet the 30-char limitation Oracle has on table names,\n   and match the usual conventions for Oracle databases, Django may shorten\n   table names and turn them all-uppercase. To prevent such transformations,\n   use a quoted name as the value for ``db_table``::\n\n       db_table = '\"name_left_in_lowercase\"'\n\n   Such quoted names can also be used with Django's other supported database\n   backends; except for Oracle, however, the quotes have no effect. See the\n   :ref:`Oracle notes <oracle-notes>` for more details.\n\n``db_tablespace``\n-----------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.db_tablespace\n\n    The name of the :doc:`database tablespace </topics/db/tablespaces>` to use\n    for this model. The default is the project's :setting:`DEFAULT_TABLESPACE`\n    setting, if set. If the backend doesn't support tablespaces, this option is\n    ignored.\n\n``default_manager_name``\n------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.default_manager_name\n\n    The name of the manager to use for the model's\n    :attr:`~django.db.models.Model._default_manager`.\n\n``default_related_name``\n------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.default_related_name\n\n    The name that will be used by default for the relation from a related object\n    back to this one. The default is ``<model_name>_set``.\n\n    This option also sets :attr:`~ForeignKey.related_query_name`.\n\n    As the reverse name for a field should be unique, be careful if you intend\n    to subclass your model. To work around name collisions, part of the name\n    should contain ``'%(app_label)s'`` and ``'%(model_name)s'``, which are\n    replaced respectively by the name of the application the model is in,\n    and the name of the model, both lowercased. See the paragraph on\n    :ref:`related names for abstract models <abstract-related-name>`.\n\n``get_latest_by``\n-----------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.get_latest_by\n\n    The name of a field or a list of field names in the model, typically\n    :class:`DateField`, :class:`DateTimeField`, or :class:`IntegerField`. This\n    specifies the default field(s) to use in your model :class:`Manager`\u2019s\n    :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` and\n    :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.earliest` methods.\n\n    Example::\n\n        # Latest by ascending order_date.\n        get_latest_by = \"order_date\"\n\n        # Latest by priority descending, order_date ascending.\n        get_latest_by = ['-priority', 'order_date']\n\n    See the :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` docs for more.\n\n``managed``\n-----------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.managed\n\n    Defaults to ``True``, meaning Django will create the appropriate database\n    tables in :djadmin:`migrate` or as part of migrations and remove them as\n    part of a :djadmin:`flush` management command. That is, Django\n    *manages* the database tables' lifecycles.\n\n    If ``False``, no database table creation or deletion operations will be\n    performed for this model. This is useful if the model represents an existing\n    table or a database view that has been created by some other means. This is\n    the *only* difference when ``managed=False``. All other aspects of\n    model handling are exactly the same as normal. This includes\n\n    #. Adding an automatic primary key field to the model if you don't\n       declare it.  To avoid confusion for later code readers, it's\n       recommended to specify all the columns from the database table you\n       are modeling when using unmanaged models.\n\n    #. If a model with ``managed=False`` contains a\n       :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` that points to another\n       unmanaged model, then the intermediate table for the many-to-many\n       join will also not be created. However, the intermediary table\n       between one managed and one unmanaged model *will* be created.\n\n       If you need to change this default behavior, create the intermediary\n       table as an explicit model (with ``managed`` set as needed) and use\n       the :attr:`ManyToManyField.through` attribute to make the relation\n       use your custom model.\n\n    For tests involving models with ``managed=False``, it's up to you to ensure\n    the correct tables are created as part of the test setup.\n\n    If you're interested in changing the Python-level behavior of a model class,\n    you *could* use ``managed=False`` and create a copy of an existing model.\n    However, there's a better approach for that situation: :ref:`proxy-models`.\n\n``order_with_respect_to``\n-------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.order_with_respect_to\n\n    Makes this object orderable with respect to the given field, usually a\n    ``ForeignKey``. This can be used to make related objects orderable with\n    respect to a parent object. For example, if an ``Answer`` relates to a\n    ``Question`` object, and a question has more than one answer, and the order\n    of answers matters, you'd do this::\n\n        from django.db import models\n\n        class Question(models.Model):\n            text = models.TextField()\n            # ...\n\n        class Answer(models.Model):\n            question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n            # ...\n\n            class Meta:\n                order_with_respect_to = 'question'\n\n    When ``order_with_respect_to`` is set, two additional methods are provided to\n    retrieve and to set the order of the related objects: ``get_RELATED_order()``\n    and ``set_RELATED_order()``, where ``RELATED`` is the lowercased model name. For\n    example, assuming that a ``Question`` object has multiple related ``Answer``\n    objects, the list returned contains the primary keys of the related ``Answer``\n    objects::\n\n        >>> question = Question.objects.get(id=1)\n        >>> question.get_answer_order()\n        [1, 2, 3]\n\n    The order of a ``Question`` object's related ``Answer`` objects can be set by\n    passing in a list of ``Answer`` primary keys::\n\n        >>> question.set_answer_order([3, 1, 2])\n\n    The related objects also get two methods, ``get_next_in_order()`` and\n    ``get_previous_in_order()``, which can be used to access those objects in their\n    proper order. Assuming the ``Answer`` objects are ordered by ``id``::\n\n        >>> answer = Answer.objects.get(id=2)\n        >>> answer.get_next_in_order()\n        <Answer: 3>\n        >>> answer.get_previous_in_order()\n        <Answer: 1>\n\n.. admonition:: ``order_with_respect_to`` implicitly sets the ``ordering`` option\n\n    Internally, ``order_with_respect_to`` adds an additional field/database\n    column named ``_order`` and sets the model's :attr:`~Options.ordering`\n    option to this field. Consequently, ``order_with_respect_to`` and\n    ``ordering`` cannot be used together, and the ordering added by\n    ``order_with_respect_to`` will apply whenever you obtain a list of objects\n    of this model.\n\n.. admonition:: Changing ``order_with_respect_to``\n\n    Because ``order_with_respect_to`` adds a new database column, be sure to\n    make and apply the appropriate migrations if you add or change\n    ``order_with_respect_to`` after your initial :djadmin:`migrate`.\n\n``ordering``\n------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.ordering\n\n    The default ordering for the object, for use when obtaining lists of objects::\n\n        ordering = ['-order_date']\n\n    This is a tuple or list of strings and/or query expressions. Each string is\n    a field name with an optional \"-\" prefix, which indicates descending order.\n    Fields without a leading \"-\" will be ordered ascending. Use the string \"?\"\n    to order randomly.\n\n    For example, to order by a ``pub_date`` field ascending, use this::\n\n        ordering = ['pub_date']\n\n    To order by ``pub_date`` descending, use this::\n\n        ordering = ['-pub_date']\n\n    To order by ``pub_date`` descending, then by ``author`` ascending, use this::\n\n        ordering = ['-pub_date', 'author']\n\n    You can also use :doc:`query expressions </ref/models/expressions>`. To\n    order by ``author`` ascending and make null values sort last, use this::\n\n        from django.db.models import F\n\n        ordering = [F('author').asc(nulls_last=True)]\n\n    Default ordering also affects :ref:`aggregation queries\n    <aggregation-ordering-interaction>` but this won't be the case starting\n    in Django 3.1.\n\n.. warning::\n\n    Ordering is not a free operation. Each field you add to the ordering\n    incurs a cost to your database. Each foreign key you add will\n    implicitly include all of its default orderings as well.\n\n    If a query doesn't have an ordering specified, results are returned from\n    the database in an unspecified order. A particular ordering is guaranteed\n    only when ordering by a set of fields that uniquely identify each object in\n    the results. For example, if a ``name`` field isn't unique, ordering by it\n    won't guarantee objects with the same name always appear in the same order.\n\n``permissions``\n---------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.permissions\n\n    Extra permissions to enter into the permissions table when creating this object.\n    Add, change, delete, and view permissions are automatically created for each\n    model. This example specifies an extra permission, ``can_deliver_pizzas``::\n\n        permissions = [('can_deliver_pizzas', 'Can deliver pizzas')]\n\n    This is a list or tuple of 2-tuples in the format ``(permission_code,\n    human_readable_permission_name)``.\n\n``default_permissions``\n-----------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.default_permissions\n\n    Defaults to ``('add', 'change', 'delete', 'view')``. You may customize this\n    list, for example, by setting this to an empty list if your app doesn't\n    require any of the default permissions. It must be specified on the model\n    before the model is created by :djadmin:`migrate` in order to prevent any\n    omitted permissions from being created.\n\n``proxy``\n---------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.proxy\n\n    If ``proxy = True``, a model which subclasses another model will be treated as\n    a :ref:`proxy model <proxy-models>`.\n\n``required_db_features``\n------------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.required_db_features\n\n    List of database features that the current connection should have so that\n    the model is considered during the migration phase. For example, if you set\n    this list to ``['gis_enabled']``, the model will only be synchronized on\n    GIS-enabled databases. It's also useful to skip some models when testing\n    with several database backends. Avoid relations between models that may or\n    may not be created as the ORM doesn't handle this.\n\n``required_db_vendor``\n----------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.required_db_vendor\n\n    Name of a supported database vendor that this model is specific to. Current\n    built-in vendor names are: ``sqlite``, ``postgresql``, ``mysql``,\n    ``oracle``. If this attribute is not empty and the current connection vendor\n    doesn't match it, the model will not be synchronized.\n\n``select_on_save``\n------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.select_on_save\n\n    Determines if Django will use the pre-1.6\n    :meth:`django.db.models.Model.save()` algorithm. The old algorithm\n    uses ``SELECT`` to determine if there is an existing row to be updated.\n    The new algorithm tries an ``UPDATE`` directly. In some rare cases the\n    ``UPDATE`` of an existing row isn't visible to Django. An example is the\n    PostgreSQL ``ON UPDATE`` trigger which returns ``NULL``. In such cases the\n    new algorithm will end up doing an ``INSERT`` even when a row exists in\n    the database.\n\n    Usually there is no need to set this attribute. The default is\n    ``False``.\n\n    See :meth:`django.db.models.Model.save()` for more about the old and\n    new saving algorithm.\n\n``indexes``\n-----------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.indexes\n\n    A list of :doc:`indexes </ref/models/indexes>` that you want to define on\n    the model::\n\n        from django.db import models\n\n        class Customer(models.Model):\n            first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n            last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n            class Meta:\n                indexes = [\n                    models.Index(fields=['last_name', 'first_name']),\n                    models.Index(fields=['first_name'], name='first_name_idx'),\n                ]\n\n``unique_together``\n-------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.unique_together\n\n    .. admonition:: Use :class:`.UniqueConstraint` with the :attr:`~Options.constraints` option instead.\n\n        :class:`.UniqueConstraint` provides more functionality than\n        ``unique_together``. ``unique_together`` may be deprecated in the\n        future.\n\n    Sets of field names that, taken together, must be unique::\n\n        unique_together = [['driver', 'restaurant']]\n\n    This is a list of lists that must be unique when considered together.\n    It's used in the Django admin and is enforced at the database level (i.e., the\n    appropriate ``UNIQUE`` statements are included in the ``CREATE TABLE``\n    statement).\n\n    For convenience, ``unique_together`` can be a single list when dealing with\n    a single set of fields::\n\n        unique_together = ['driver', 'restaurant']\n\n    A :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` cannot be included in\n    unique_together. (It's not clear what that would even mean!) If you\n    need to validate uniqueness related to a\n    :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField`, try using a signal or\n    an explicit :attr:`through <ManyToManyField.through>` model.\n\n    The ``ValidationError`` raised during model validation when the constraint\n    is violated has the ``unique_together`` error code.\n\n``index_together``\n------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.index_together\n\n    .. admonition:: Use the :attr:`~Options.indexes` option instead.\n\n        The newer :attr:`~Options.indexes` option provides more functionality\n        than ``index_together``. ``index_together`` may be deprecated in the\n        future.\n\n    Sets of field names that, taken together, are indexed::\n\n        index_together = [\n            [\"pub_date\", \"deadline\"],\n        ]\n\n    This list of fields will be indexed together (i.e. the appropriate\n    ``CREATE INDEX`` statement will be issued.)\n\n    For convenience, ``index_together`` can be a single list when dealing with a single\n    set of fields::\n\n        index_together = [\"pub_date\", \"deadline\"]\n\n``constraints``\n---------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.constraints\n\n    .. versionadded:: 2.2\n\n    A list of :doc:`constraints </ref/models/constraints>` that you want to\n    define on the model::\n\n        from django.db import models\n\n        class Customer(models.Model):\n            age = models.IntegerField()\n\n            class Meta:\n                constraints = [\n                    models.CheckConstraint(check=models.Q(age__gte=18), name='age_gte_18'),\n                ]\n\n``verbose_name``\n----------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.verbose_name\n\n    A human-readable name for the object, singular::\n\n        verbose_name = \"pizza\"\n\n    If this isn't given, Django will use a munged version of the class name:\n    ``CamelCase`` becomes ``camel case``.\n\n``verbose_name_plural``\n-----------------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.verbose_name_plural\n\n    The plural name for the object::\n\n        verbose_name_plural = \"stories\"\n\n    If this isn't given, Django will use :attr:`~Options.verbose_name` + ``\"s\"``.\n\nRead-only ``Meta`` attributes\n=============================\n\n``label``\n---------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.label\n\n    Representation of the object, returns ``app_label.object_name``, e.g.\n    ``'polls.Question'``.\n\n``label_lower``\n---------------\n\n.. attribute:: Options.label_lower\n\n    Representation of the model, returns ``app_label.model_name``, e.g.\n    ``'polls.question'``.\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_11", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": "Okay, so from the documentation, `Meta.ordering` can accept a list of strings or query expressions.
