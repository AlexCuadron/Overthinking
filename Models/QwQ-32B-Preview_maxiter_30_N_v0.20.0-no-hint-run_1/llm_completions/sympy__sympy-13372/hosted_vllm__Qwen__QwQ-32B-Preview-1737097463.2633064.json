Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

I can use the `execute_bash` function to run commands like `ls` and `tree` to see what's inside the `/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1` directory.\n\nLet me first check the current directory and list its contents:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"pwd && ls /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1\"}"}}]}, {"content": "/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1\nAUTHORS  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  LICENSE  MANIFEST.in  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md  README.rst  bin  conftest.py  data  doc  examples  github_deploy_key.enc  release  setup.py  setupegg.py  sympy  sympy.egg-info  tox.ini.sample\n[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "execute_bash"}], "fncall_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-caed9b52da8c4a2aa8f4d4aac061fb59", "created": 1737097377, "model": "hosted_vllm/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "Okay, so the repository contains various files and directories typical for a Python project: `AUTHORS`, `LICENSE`, `setup.py`, etc., and a `sympy` directory which probably contains the source code.\n\nI need to fix an issue in the `evalf` method, which is likely part of the SymPy library. So, the relevant code is probably in the `sympy` directory.\n\nFrom the error message in the PR description:\n\n```\nFile \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1285, in evalf\nrf = evalf_table[x.func]\nKeyError: Max\n\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1394, in evalf\nresult = evalf(self, prec + 4, options)\nFile \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1286, in evalf\nr = rf(x, prec, options)\nFile \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 538, in evalf_mul\narg = evalf(arg, prec, options)\nFile \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1308, in evalf\nr = re, im, reprec, imprec\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'reprec' referenced before assignment\n```\n\nThis suggests that there's an issue in `sympy/core/evalf.py`, specifically around lines 1285 and 1308.\n\nThe user mentioned that the error occurs when evaluating a `Mul` expression with `Max` function in it, and that the order of arguments in `Mul` affects whether the error occurs or not.\n\nGiven that, I should look into the `evalf` method in `sympy/core/evalf.py`, particularly how it handles `Mul` expressions involving `Max`.\n\nFirst, I need to reproduce the error to understand what's going wrong.\n\nLet me create a small Python script to reproduce the issue.\n\nI'll create a file called `reproduce_error.py` with the following content:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Mul, Max\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n\n# First expression: x * Max(0, y)\nexpr1 = Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False)\nprint(expr1.evalf())\n\n# Second expression: Max(0, y) * x\nexpr2 = Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False)\nprint(expr2.evalf())\n```\n\nAccording to the PR description, the first expression should evaluate fine, while the second one should raise an UnboundLocalError.\n\nI need to run this script in the environment where the SymPy code is.\n\nI can use the `execute_bash` function to run this script.\n\nFirst, I need to create the `reproduce_error.py` file.\n\nI can use the `str_replace_editor` function to create this file.\n\nLet me do that.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1/reproduce_error.py\", \"file_text\": \"from sympy import symbols, Mul, Max\\n\\nx, y = symbols('x y')\\n\\n# First expression: x * Max(0, y)\\nexpr1 = Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False)\\nprint(expr1.evalf())\\n\\n# Second expression: Max(0, y) * x\\nexpr2 = Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False)\\nprint(expr2.evalf())\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_02", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 780, "prompt_tokens": 4187, "total_tokens": 4967, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
