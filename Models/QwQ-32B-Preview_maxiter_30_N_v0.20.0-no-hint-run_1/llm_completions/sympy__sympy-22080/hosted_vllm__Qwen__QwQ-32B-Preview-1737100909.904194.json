The problem is that `lambdify` is moving multipliers inside the `Mod` function in a way that changes the behavior of the expression.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the issue clearly. From the PR description, it seems that when we have an expression like `expr * Mod(a, b)`, and we lambdify it with `modules=[]`, SymPy transforms it into `Mod(expr * a, b)`, which is not the desired behavior. The user expects the multiplier to remain outside the `Mod` function.\n\nTo tackle this, I'll follow the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Explore the repository structure:**\n   - Since I'm dealing with a SymPy repository, I should be familiar with where the relevant code is located.\n   - SymPy is a large library, so identifying the specific module and file that handles `lambdify` is crucial.\n\n2. **Create a script to reproduce the error:**\n   - I need to write a Python script that demonstrates the issue as described in the PR.\n   - This will help me verify that my fix works correctly.\n\n3. **Edit the source code to resolve the issue:**\n   - Once I've identified where the problem lies, I'll make the necessary changes to the code.\n   - The changes should be minimal and targeted to fix this specific behavior.\n\n4. **Rerun the reproduce script to confirm the fix:**\n   - After making the changes, I'll run the same script again to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\n5. **Consider edge cases:**\n   - It's important to think about various scenarios where the `Mod` function might be used in expressions and ensure that the fix doesn't introduce new issues.\n\nLet's start with step 1: exploring the repository structure.\n\n## Step 1: Explore the Repository Structure\n\nI need to navigate the SymPy repository to find where the `lambdify` function is defined. SymPy's source code is organized into several modules, and `lambdify` is part of the printing module.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the `lambdify` function in the repository. I believe it's located in the `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` file.\n\nTo confirm this, I'll search for the function definition.\n\n## Step 2: Create a Script to Reproduce the Error\n\nBefore diving into the code, I should create a script that reproduces the issue. This will serve as a test to ensure that my fix works correctly.\n\nFrom the PR description, the issue can be reproduced with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Mod, lambdify, symbols\nimport inspect\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\nexpr = -Mod(x, y)\nf = lambdify([x, y], expr)\nprint(f(3, 7))  # Expected: -3\nprint(inspect.getsource(f))\n\ng = lambdify([x, y], expr, modules=[])\nprint(g(3, 7))  # Expected: -3, but gets 4\nprint(inspect.getsource(g))\n```\n\nAccording to the description, `f(3, 7)` correctly returns `-3`, while `g(3, 7)` incorrectly returns `4`. The source of `g` shows that it's being translated to `return (-x % y)`, which is the cause of the discrepancy.\n\nI need to run this script in the current environment to confirm the issue.\n\n## Step 3: Edit the Source Code to Resolve the Issue\n\nNow, I need to locate the part of the code that's responsible for translating SymPy expressions into lambda functions, specifically focusing on how the `Mod` function is handled when `modules=[]`.\n\nGiven that `modules=[]` indicates that no specific modules are allowed, SymPy should use only built-in functions for the lambdification.\n\nI suspect that the issue lies in how the `Mod` function is being translated into the corresponding built-in function.\n\nIn Python, the modulo operator `%` is equivalent to `math.fmod` for floating points and the built-in `divmod` for integers. However, SymPy's `Mod` function corresponds to the built-in `%` operator.\n\nThe problem seems to be that when multiplying `Mod(a, b)` by `expr`, the lambdification process is incorrectly moving `expr` inside the `Mod` function.\n\nI need to look into the `lambdify` translation mechanism to see how it handles `Mod`.\n\n## Step 4: Rerun the Reproduce Script to Confirm the Fix\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to the source code, I'll rerun the reproduce script to ensure that the issue is resolved. That is, both `f(3, 7)` and `g(3, 7)` should return `-3`.\n\nAdditionally, I should check that the source code of `g` now correctly represents the expression without moving the multiplier inside the `Mod` function.\n\n## Step 5: Consider Edge Cases\n\nTo ensure that the fix is robust, I need to consider various edge cases where the `Mod` function might be used in different expressions. For example:\n\n- When `expr` is a constant.\n- When `expr` is a more complex expression.\n- When `expr` is negative or positive.\n- When `a` and `b` are symbolic or numeric.\n\nI should create additional test cases to verify that the fix doesn't introduce new issues in these scenarios.\n\n## Final Solution\n\nTo resolve the issue with the `lambdify` function moving multipliers inside the `Mod` function when `modules=[]`, we need to modify the translation process in SymPy to handle such cases correctly. The problem arises because the current implementation incorrectly transforms expressions like `expr * Mod(a, b)` into `Mod(expr * a, b)`, which changes the behavior of the expression.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Issue:** The `lambdify` function, when using `modules=[]`, translates SymPy expressions directly to Python expressions.

The problem is that `lambdify` is moving multipliers inside the `Mod` function in a way that changes the behavior of the expression.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the issue clearly. From the PR description, it seems that when we have an expression like `expr * Mod(a, b)`, and we lambdify it with `modules=[]`, SymPy transforms it into `Mod(expr * a, b)`, which is not the desired behavior. The user expects the multiplier to remain outside the `Mod` function.\n\nTo tackle this, I'll follow the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Explore the repository structure:**\n   - Since I'm dealing with a SymPy repository, I should be familiar with where the relevant code is located.\n   - SymPy is a large library, so identifying the specific module and file that handles `lambdify` is crucial.\n\n2. **Create a script to reproduce the error:**\n   - I need to write a Python script that demonstrates the issue as described in the PR.\n   - This will help me verify that my fix works correctly.\n\n3. **Edit the source code to resolve the issue:**\n   - Once I've identified where the problem lies, I'll make the necessary changes to the code.\n   - The changes should be minimal and targeted to fix this specific behavior.\n\n4. **Rerun the reproduce script to confirm the fix:**\n   - After making the changes, I'll run the same script again to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\n5. **Consider edge cases:**\n   - It's important to think about various scenarios where the `Mod` function might be used in expressions and ensure that the fix doesn't introduce new issues.\n\nLet's start with step 1: exploring the repository structure.\n\n## Step 1: Explore the Repository Structure\n\nI need to navigate the SymPy repository to find where the `lambdify` function is defined. SymPy's source code is organized into several modules, and `lambdify` is part of the printing module.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the `lambdify` function in the repository. I believe it's located in the `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` file.\n\nTo confirm this, I'll search for the function definition.\n\n## Step 2: Create a Script to Reproduce the Error\n\nBefore diving into the code, I should create a script that reproduces the issue. This will serve as a test to ensure that my fix works correctly.\n\nFrom the PR description, the issue can be reproduced with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Mod, lambdify, symbols\nimport inspect\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\nexpr = -Mod(x, y)\nf = lambdify([x, y], expr)\nprint(f(3, 7))  # Expected: -3\nprint(inspect.getsource(f))\n\ng = lambdify([x, y], expr, modules=[])\nprint(g(3, 7))  # Expected: -3, but gets 4\nprint(inspect.getsource(g))\n```\n\nAccording to the description, `f(3, 7)` correctly returns `-3`, while `g(3, 7)` incorrectly returns `4`. The source of `g` shows that it's being translated to `return (-x % y)`, which is the cause of the discrepancy.\n\nI need to run this script in the current environment to confirm the issue.\n\n## Step 3: Edit the Source Code to Resolve the Issue\n\nNow, I need to locate the part of the code that's responsible for translating SymPy expressions into lambda functions, specifically focusing on how the `Mod` function is handled when `modules=[]`.\n\nGiven that `modules=[]` indicates that no specific modules are allowed, SymPy should use only built-in functions for the lambdification.\n\nI suspect that the issue lies in how the `Mod` function is being translated into the corresponding built-in function.\n\nIn Python, the modulo operator `%` is equivalent to `math.fmod` for floating points and the built-in `divmod` for integers. However, SymPy's `Mod` function corresponds to the built-in `%` operator.\n\nThe problem seems to be that when multiplying `Mod(a, b)` by `expr`, the lambdification process is incorrectly moving `expr` inside the `Mod` function.\n\nI need to look into the `lambdify` translation mechanism to see how it handles `Mod`.\n\n## Step 4: Rerun the Reproduce Script to Confirm the Fix\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to the source code, I'll rerun the reproduce script to ensure that the issue is resolved. That is, both `f(3, 7)` and `g(3, 7)` should return `-3`.\n\nAdditionally, I should check that the source code of `g` now correctly represents the expression without moving the multiplier inside the `Mod` function.\n\n## Step 5: Consider Edge Cases\n\nTo ensure that the fix is robust, I need to consider various edge cases where the `Mod` function might be used in different expressions. For example:\n\n- When `expr` is a constant.\n- When `expr` is a more complex expression.\n- When `expr` is negative or positive.\n- When `a` and `b` are symbolic or numeric.\n\nI should create additional test cases to verify that the fix doesn't introduce new issues in these scenarios.\n\n## Final Solution\n\nTo resolve the issue with the `lambdify` function moving multipliers inside the `Mod` function when `modules=[]`, we need to modify the translation process in SymPy to handle such cases correctly. The problem arises because the current implementation incorrectly transforms expressions like `expr * Mod(a, b)` into `Mod(expr * a, b)`, which changes the behavior of the expression.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Issue:** The `lambdify` function, when using `modules=[]`, translates SymPy expressions directly to Python expressions.
