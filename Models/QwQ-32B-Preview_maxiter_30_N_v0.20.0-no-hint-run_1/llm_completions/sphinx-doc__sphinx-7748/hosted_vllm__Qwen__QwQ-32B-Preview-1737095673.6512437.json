The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

The PR description mentions an issue with `autodoc_docstring_signature` when dealing with overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes. The goal is to make sure that all signatures of overloaded methods are picked up, not just the first one.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the context here. SWIG is a tool that connects C++ code to Python, allowing us to use C++ classes and methods in Python. When methods are overloaded in C++, meaning there are multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, SWIG typically includes all these signatures in the docstring of the wrapped Python method.\n\nNow, Sphinx is a tool that generates documentation from Python docstrings and code comments. The `autodoc` extension in Sphinx can automatically insert documentation from docstrings. The `autodoc_docstring_signature` seems to be related to extracting the signature from the docstring.\n\nThe problem is that currently, it only picks up the first signature in the docstring, but we need it to pick up all of them for overloaded methods.\n\nMy task is to make minimal changes to the non-test files in the repository to fix this issue.\n\n## Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nBefore diving into code changes, I should understand the structure of the repository.
