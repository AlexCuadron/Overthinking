The problem is about overriding the widget in the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method, which isn't working as expected, unlike `formfield_for_foreignkey()`. My goal is to make the minimal changes to non-test files to satisfy this requirement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this is about. Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It comes with an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system and admin site, among other features.\n\nIn Django, when you're working with models that have many-to-many relationships, you can customize the form fields used to edit these relationships in the admin site. The `formfield_for_manytomany()` method is used to override the default form field for a many-to-many relationship, allowing you to specify a different widget or other form field properties.\n\nSimilarly, `formfield_for_foreignkey()` is used for foreign key relationships. According to the problem description, setting the widget parameter in `formfield_for_manytomany()` doesn't work, whereas it does in `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\nSo, the task is to fix this discrepancy so that the widget can be overridden in `formfield_for_manytomany()` just like in `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nBefore diving into code changes, I should understand the structure of the Django repository. Since it's Django version 3.1, I can refer to the official Django 3.1 documentation for guidance.\n\nTypically, the Django repository has the following structure:\n\n- `django/`: Contains the Django source code.\n\n- `tests/`: Contains test cases.\n\n- `docs/`: Contains documentation.\n\n- `examples/`: Sometimes contains example projects.\n\n- `setup.py`: Setup configuration for packaging and installation.\n\nGiven that I don't need to modify any test files, I should focus on the `django/` directory, specifically the admin module, where `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` are defined.\n\n### Step 2: Reproduce the Error\n\nTo confirm the issue, I need to create a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.\n\nI'll create a simple Django project with an app that has models with many-to-many and foreign key relationships. Then, I'll create a custom ModelAdmin that overrides `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` to set custom widgets.\n\nHere's a plan for the reproduce script:\n\n1. Create a new Django project.\n\n2. Create a new app within the project.\n\n3. Define models with many-to-many and foreign key relationships.\n\n4. Create a custom ModelAdmin that overrides `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` to set custom widgets.\n\n5. Register the models with the custom ModelAdmin.\n\n6. Start the Django admin site and check if the widgets are correctly overridden for both foreign key and many-to-many fields.\n\nSince I'm working in a headless environment, I can't actually open a browser, but I can simulate the form field generation and check if the widgets are set correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Reproduce Script\n\nI'll write a Python script to set up the Django project, define the models and admin, and then programmatically check the widgets used in the form fields.\n\nLet's outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Set up Django environment.\n\n2. Define models with many-to-many and foreign key relationships.\n\n3. Create a custom ModelAdmin overriding `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\n4. Register the models with the custom ModelAdmin.\n\n5. Instantiate the ModelForm and check the widgets used for the many-to-many and foreign key fields.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of what the code might look like:\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django import forms\n\n# Set up Django\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define models\nclass Author(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Publisher(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Book(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)\n    publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n# Custom ModelAdmin\nclass BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def formfield_for_manytomany(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'authors':\n            kwargs['widget'] = forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple\n        return super().formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'publisher':\n            kwargs['widget'] = forms.RadioSelect\n        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n# Register models\nadmin.site.register(Author)\nadmin.site.register(Publisher)\nadmin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)\n\n# Programmatically check the widgets\nma = admin.site._registry[Book]\nform = ma.get_form(request=None)()\n\n# Check foreign key widget\npublisher_field = form.fields['publisher']\nassert isinstance(publisher_field.widget, forms.RadioSelect), \"ForeignKey widget not overridden correctly\"\n\n# Check many-to-many widget\nauthors_field = form.fields['authors']\nassert isinstance(authors_field.widget, forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple), \"ManyToMany widget not overridden correctly\"\n\nprint(\"All checks passed.\")\n```\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Reproduce Script\n\nI need to save this script in a file, say `reproduce.py`, and run it using the Django version in the repository.\n\nHowever, since I'm in a headless environment, I need to make sure that Django is set up correctly and that the script can be executed.\n\nI should also ensure that the necessary settings are configured for the script to run properly.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Issue\n\nAssuming the script is executed and it fails at the assertion for the many-to-many field, indicating that the widget was not overridden correctly, I need to investigate why this is happening.\n\nI should look into the Django source code, specifically in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, where `ModelAdmin` class defines `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` methods.\n\nI need to compare how these two methods are implemented and see why the widget override works for foreign keys but not for many-to-many fields.\n\n### Step 6: Debugging\n\nTo debug, I can add print statements or use Django's logging to see what's happening inside `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\nI should check:\n\n- Whether `formfield_for_manytomany()` is being called at all.\n\n- What kwargs are being passed to it.\n\n- How the form field is being constructed and returned.\n\n- Compare this with how `formfield_for_foreignkey()` is handled.\n\n### Step 7: Fix the Issue\n\nOnce I identify why the widget override isn't working for many-to-many fields, I can make the necessary changes in the Django source code to fix it.\n\nThis might involve:\n\n- Modifying the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method to correctly apply the widget override.\n\n- Ensuring that any subsequent processing of the form field doesn't overwrite the widget.\n\n- Possibly making changes in how the form field is constructed for many-to-many relationships.\n\n### Step 8: Verify the Fix\n\nAfter making the changes, I need to rerun the reproduce script to ensure that the assertion for the many-to-many field now passes.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about edge cases, such as:\n\n- Overriding widgets for different types of many-to-many fields.\n\n- Ensuring that other form field properties are not affected by this change.\n\n- Checking if this change introduces any regressions in foreign key field handling.\n\n### Step 9: Document the Changes\n\nFinally, I should document the changes made, including any notes on why certain modifications were necessary and how they resolve the issue.\n\nThis documentation will be useful for future reference and for other developers who might encounter similar problems.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this issue, we need to ensure that the widget can be overridden in the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method similarly to how it is done in `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.

The problem is about overriding the widget in the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method, which isn't working as expected, unlike `formfield_for_foreignkey()`. My goal is to make the minimal changes to non-test files to satisfy this requirement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this is about. Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It comes with an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system and admin site, among other features.\n\nIn Django, when you're working with models that have many-to-many relationships, you can customize the form fields used to edit these relationships in the admin site. The `formfield_for_manytomany()` method is used to override the default form field for a many-to-many relationship, allowing you to specify a different widget or other form field properties.\n\nSimilarly, `formfield_for_foreignkey()` is used for foreign key relationships. According to the problem description, setting the widget parameter in `formfield_for_manytomany()` doesn't work, whereas it does in `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\nSo, the task is to fix this discrepancy so that the widget can be overridden in `formfield_for_manytomany()` just like in `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nBefore diving into code changes, I should understand the structure of the Django repository. Since it's Django version 3.1, I can refer to the official Django 3.1 documentation for guidance.\n\nTypically, the Django repository has the following structure:\n\n- `django/`: Contains the Django source code.\n\n- `tests/`: Contains test cases.\n\n- `docs/`: Contains documentation.\n\n- `examples/`: Sometimes contains example projects.\n\n- `setup.py`: Setup configuration for packaging and installation.\n\nGiven that I don't need to modify any test files, I should focus on the `django/` directory, specifically the admin module, where `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` are defined.\n\n### Step 2: Reproduce the Error\n\nTo confirm the issue, I need to create a minimal example that demonstrates the problem.\n\nI'll create a simple Django project with an app that has models with many-to-many and foreign key relationships. Then, I'll create a custom ModelAdmin that overrides `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` to set custom widgets.\n\nHere's a plan for the reproduce script:\n\n1. Create a new Django project.\n\n2. Create a new app within the project.\n\n3. Define models with many-to-many and foreign key relationships.\n\n4. Create a custom ModelAdmin that overrides `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` to set custom widgets.\n\n5. Register the models with the custom ModelAdmin.\n\n6. Start the Django admin site and check if the widgets are correctly overridden for both foreign key and many-to-many fields.\n\nSince I'm working in a headless environment, I can't actually open a browser, but I can simulate the form field generation and check if the widgets are set correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Reproduce Script\n\nI'll write a Python script to set up the Django project, define the models and admin, and then programmatically check the widgets used in the form fields.\n\nLet's outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Set up Django environment.\n\n2. Define models with many-to-many and foreign key relationships.\n\n3. Create a custom ModelAdmin overriding `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\n4. Register the models with the custom ModelAdmin.\n\n5. Instantiate the ModelForm and check the widgets used for the many-to-many and foreign key fields.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of what the code might look like:\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django import forms\n\n# Set up Django\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define models\nclass Author(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Publisher(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Book(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)\n    publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n# Custom ModelAdmin\nclass BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def formfield_for_manytomany(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'authors':\n            kwargs['widget'] = forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple\n        return super().formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'publisher':\n            kwargs['widget'] = forms.RadioSelect\n        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n# Register models\nadmin.site.register(Author)\nadmin.site.register(Publisher)\nadmin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)\n\n# Programmatically check the widgets\nma = admin.site._registry[Book]\nform = ma.get_form(request=None)()\n\n# Check foreign key widget\npublisher_field = form.fields['publisher']\nassert isinstance(publisher_field.widget, forms.RadioSelect), \"ForeignKey widget not overridden correctly\"\n\n# Check many-to-many widget\nauthors_field = form.fields['authors']\nassert isinstance(authors_field.widget, forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple), \"ManyToMany widget not overridden correctly\"\n\nprint(\"All checks passed.\")\n```\n\n### Step 4: Execute the Reproduce Script\n\nI need to save this script in a file, say `reproduce.py`, and run it using the Django version in the repository.\n\nHowever, since I'm in a headless environment, I need to make sure that Django is set up correctly and that the script can be executed.\n\nI should also ensure that the necessary settings are configured for the script to run properly.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Issue\n\nAssuming the script is executed and it fails at the assertion for the many-to-many field, indicating that the widget was not overridden correctly, I need to investigate why this is happening.\n\nI should look into the Django source code, specifically in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, where `ModelAdmin` class defines `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` methods.\n\nI need to compare how these two methods are implemented and see why the widget override works for foreign keys but not for many-to-many fields.\n\n### Step 6: Debugging\n\nTo debug, I can add print statements or use Django's logging to see what's happening inside `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()`.\n\nI should check:\n\n- Whether `formfield_for_manytomany()` is being called at all.\n\n- What kwargs are being passed to it.\n\n- How the form field is being constructed and returned.\n\n- Compare this with how `formfield_for_foreignkey()` is handled.\n\n### Step 7: Fix the Issue\n\nOnce I identify why the widget override isn't working for many-to-many fields, I can make the necessary changes in the Django source code to fix it.\n\nThis might involve:\n\n- Modifying the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method to correctly apply the widget override.\n\n- Ensuring that any subsequent processing of the form field doesn't overwrite the widget.\n\n- Possibly making changes in how the form field is constructed for many-to-many relationships.\n\n### Step 8: Verify the Fix\n\nAfter making the changes, I need to rerun the reproduce script to ensure that the assertion for the many-to-many field now passes.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about edge cases, such as:\n\n- Overriding widgets for different types of many-to-many fields.\n\n- Ensuring that other form field properties are not affected by this change.\n\n- Checking if this change introduces any regressions in foreign key field handling.\n\n### Step 9: Document the Changes\n\nFinally, I should document the changes made, including any notes on why certain modifications were necessary and how they resolve the issue.\n\nThis documentation will be useful for future reference and for other developers who might encounter similar problems.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this issue, we need to ensure that the widget can be overridden in the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method similarly to how it is done in `formfield_for_foreignkey()`. The problem seems to be that the widget override isn't being applied correctly for many-to-many fields in Django's admin interface.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Reproduce the Error:**\n   - Create a minimal Django project with models containing many-to-many and foreign key relationships.\n   - Define a custom `ModelAdmin` that overrides `formfield_for_manytomany()` and `formfield_for_foreignkey()` to set custom widgets.\n   - Programmatically check if the widgets are correctly overridden for both foreign key and many-to-many fields.\n\n2. **Identify the Issue:**\n   - Examine the Django source code, specifically in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, to understand why the widget override works for foreign keys but not for many-to-many fields.\n\n3. **Fix the Issue:**\n   - Modify the `formfield_for_manytomany()` method to correctly apply the widget override.\n   - Ensure that any subsequent processing of the form field does not overwrite the widget.\n\n4. **Verify the Fix:**\n   - Rerun the reproduce script to confirm that the widget override now works for many-to-many fields.\n   - Consider edge cases to ensure the fix is robust.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n1. **Reproduce Script (`reproduce.py`):**\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django import forms\n\n# Set up Django\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define models\nclass Author(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Publisher(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Book(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)\n    publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n# Custom ModelAdmin\nclass BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def formfield_for_manytomany(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'authors':\n            kwargs['widget'] = forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple\n        return super().formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'publisher':\n            kwargs['widget'] = forms.RadioSelect\n        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\n# Register models\nadmin.site.register(Author)\nadmin.site.register(Publisher)\nadmin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)\n\n# Programmatically check the widgets\nma = admin.site._registry[Book]\nform = ma.get_form(request=None)()\n\n# Check foreign key widget\npublisher_field = form.fields['publisher']\nassert isinstance(publisher_field.widget, forms.RadioSelect), \"ForeignKey widget not overridden correctly\"\n\n# Check many-to-many widget\nauthors_field = form.fields['authors']\nassert isinstance(authors_field.widget, forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple), \"ManyToMany widget not overridden correctly\"\n\nprint(\"All checks passed.\")\n```\n\n2. **Fix in Django Source Code:**\n\n   - The issue lies in how `formfield_for_manytomany()` is implemented in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.
