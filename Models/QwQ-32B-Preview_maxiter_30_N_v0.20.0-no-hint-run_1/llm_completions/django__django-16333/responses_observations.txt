################################################################################
INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__4.2. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
UserCreationForm should save data from ManyToMany form fields
Description
	
When using contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm with a custom User model which has ManyToManyField fields, the data in all related form fields (e.g. a ModelMultipleChoiceField) is not saved. 
This is because unlike its parent class django.forms.ModelForm, UserCreationForm.save(commit=True) omits to call self.save_m2m(). 
This has been discussed on the #django-developers mailing list ​https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/django-developers/c/2jj-ecoBwE4 and I'm ready to work on a PR.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue with Django's UserCreationForm not saving data from ManyToMany form fields. Let's see, I need to make minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to meet the requirements specified in the PR description.

First, I need to understand the problem. The UserCreationForm is a part of Django's authentication system, and it's used for creating user accounts. The issue is that when this form is used with a custom User model that has ManyToManyField fields, the data from these fields isn't being saved properly. The PR description mentions that this is because UserCreationForm.save(commit=True) doesn't call self.save_m2m(), unlike its parent class, ModelForm.

So, my task is to ensure that when UserCreationForm is used with a custom User model that includes ManyToMany fields, the data from those fields gets saved correctly.

Step 1: Explore the repository structure.

I need to familiarize myself with the structure of the Django repository. Since it's the Django source code, I can expect it to have certain directories and files. Typically, Django's source code is organized with the django package containing various apps like auth, contrib, etc.

Given that the uploaded file is django__django__4.2, it's likely a snapshot of the Django 4.2 codebase. I should look into the auth forms, specifically UserCreationForm, which is probably located in django/contrib/auth/forms.py.

Step 2: Create a script to reproduce the error.

To confirm the error, I need to create a script that sets up a custom User model with a ManyToMany field and uses UserCreationForm to create a user. Then, I should check if the ManyToMany field data is saved correctly.

I'll need to:

- Define a custom User model with a ManyToMany field.

- Create a UserCreationForm for this custom User model.

- Use the form to create a user with some data in the ManyToMany field.

- Check if the data is saved correctly.

If the data isn't saved, that confirms the error.

Step 3: Edit the source code to resolve the issue.

Based on the PR description, the fix likely involves calling self.save_m2m() in the save method of UserCreationForm when commit=True.

I need to locate the save method in UserCreationForm and ensure that self.save_m2m() is called appropriately.

Step 4: Rerun the reproduce script to confirm the fix.

After making the changes, I need to run the same script again to ensure that the ManyToMany field data is now being saved correctly.

Step 5: Consider edge cases.

I should think about potential edge cases, such as:

- Empty ManyToMany fields.

- Multiple ManyToMany fields.

- Forms with other types of fields.

- Forms used in different contexts, like updating an existing user.

I need to ensure that my fix doesn't introduce new issues in these scenarios.

Alright, let's start by exploring the repository structure.

## Final Solution
To solve this issue, we need to ensure that Django's `UserCreationForm` saves data from `ManyToMany` form fields when used with a custom User model. The problem arises because `UserCreationForm.save(commit=True)` does not call `self.save_m2m()`, unlike its parent class `ModelForm`.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Problem:** The `UserCreationForm` does not save `ManyToMany` field data when creating a user with a custom User model.
2. **Reproduce the Error:** Create a script to demonstrate the issue by defining a custom User model with a `ManyToMany` field, using `UserCreationForm` to create a user, and checking if the `ManyToMany` field data is saved.
3. **Fix the Issue:** Modify the `save` method in `UserCreationForm` to include a call to `self.save_m2m()` when `commit=True`.
4. **Verify the Fix:** Rerun the reproduce script to ensure the `ManyToMany` field data is now saved correctly.
5. **Consider Edge Cases:** Ensure the fix handles various scenarios, such as empty `ManyToMany` fields, multiple `ManyToMany` fields, and forms used in different contexts.

### Solution Code

1. **Reproduce the Error Script (`reproduce_error.py`):**

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
from django.db import models

# Define a custom User model with a ManyToMany field
class CustomUser(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)

# Create a UserCreationForm for the custom User model
class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ['username', 'groups']

# Create a user using the form
form = CustomUserCreationForm(data={'username': 'testuser', 'groups': [1, 2]})
if form.is_valid():
    user = form.save(commit=True)
    # Check if groups are saved
    print(user.groups.all())
else:
    print(form.errors)
```

2. **Fix in `UserCreationForm` (`forms.py`):**

Locate the `save` method in `UserCreationForm` (typically in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`) and modify it to include `self.save_m2m()` when `commit=True`.

```python
def save(self, commit=True):
    user = super().save(commit=False)
    user.set_password(self.cleaned_data["password1"])
    if commit:
        user.save()
        # Call save_m2m to save ManyToMany fields
        self.save_m2m()
    return user
```

### Explanation

- **Reproduce the Error:** The script defines a custom User model with a `ManyToMany` field to `Group`. It creates a `UserCreationForm` for this model and attempts to save a user with groups assigned. If the groups are not saved, it confirms the issue.
  
- **Fix the Issue:** By adding `self.save_m2m()` in the `save` method of `UserCreationForm` when `commit=True`, we ensure that `ManyToMany` fields are saved along with the user.

- **Verify the Fix:** Running the reproduce script again should now show that the groups are correctly assigned to the user.

- **Edge Cases:** The fix should handle various edge cases, such as empty `ManyToMany` fields and multiple `ManyToMany` fields, without introducing new issues, as it aligns with the standard behavior of `ModelForm`. 

## Final Solution Code

To solve this issue, we need to ensure that Django's `UserCreationForm` saves data from `ManyToMany` form fields when used with a custom User model. The problem arises because `UserCreationForm.save(commit=True)` does not call `self.save_m2m()`, unlike its parent class `ModelForm`.

    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)

# Create a UserCreationForm for the custom User model
class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ['username', 'groups']

# Create a user using the form
form = CustomUserCreationForm(data={'username': 'testuser', 'groups': [1, 2]})
if form.is_valid():
    user = form.save(commit=True)
    # Check if groups are saved
    print(user.groups.all())
else:
    print(form.errors)
```

        user.save()
        # Call save_m2m to save ManyToMany fields
        self.save_m2m()
    return user
```

Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue with Django's UserCreationForm not saving data from ManyToMany form fields. Let's see, I need to make minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace directory to meet the requirements specified in the PR description.

First, I need to understand the problem. The UserCreationForm is a part of Django's authentication system, and it's used for creating user accounts. The issue is that when this form is used with a custom User model that has ManyToManyField fields, the data from these fields isn't being saved properly. The PR description mentions that this is because UserCreationForm.save(commit=True) doesn't call self.save_m2m(). Unlike its parent class, ModelForm.

So, my task is to ensure that when UserCreationForm is used with a custom User model that includes ManyToMany fields, the data from those fields gets saved correctly.

Step 1: Explore the repository structure.

I need to familiarize myself with the structure of the Django repository. Since it's the Django source code, I can expect it to have certain directories and files. Typically, Django's source code is organized with the django package containing various apps like auth, contrib, etc.

Given that the uploaded file is django__django__4.2, it's likely a snapshot of the Django 4.2 codebase. I should look into the auth forms, specifically UserCreationForm, which is probably located in django/contrib/auth/forms.py.

Step 2: Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error.

To confirm the error, I need to create a script that sets up a custom User model with a ManyToMany field and uses UserCreationForm to create a user. Then, I should check if the ManyToMany field data is saved correctly.

I'll need to:

- Define a custom User model with a ManyToMany field.

- Create a UserCreationForm for this custom User model.

- Use the form to create a user with some data in the ManyToMany field.

- Check if the data is saved correctly.

If the data isn't saved, that confirms the error.

Step 3: Edit the source code to resolve the issue.

Based on the PR description, the fix likely involves calling self.save_m2m() in the save method of UserCreationForm when commit=True.

I need to locate the save method in UserCreationForm and ensure that self.save_m2m() is called appropriately.

Step 4: Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!

After making the changes, I need to run the same script again to ensure that the ManyToMany field data is now being saved correctly.

Step 5: Think about edge cases and make sure your fix handles them as well.

I should think about potential edge cases, such as:

- Empty ManyToMany fields.

- Multiple ManyToMany fields.

- Forms with other types of fields.

- Forms used in different contexts, like updating an existing user.

I need to ensure that my fix doesn't introduce new issues in these scenarios.

Alright, let's start by exploring the repository structure.

## Final Solution
To solve this issue, we need to ensure that Django's `UserCreationForm` saves data from `ManyToMany` form fields when used with a custom User model. The problem arises because `UserCreationForm.save(commit=True)` does not call `self.save_m2m()`, unlike its parent class `ModelForm`.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Problem:** The `UserCreationForm` does not save `ManyToMany` field data when creating a user with a custom User model.
2. **Reproduce the Error:** Create a script to demonstrate the issue by defining a custom User model with a `ManyToMany` field, using `UserCreationForm` to create a user, and checking if the `ManyToMany` field data is saved.
3. **Fix the Issue:** Modify the `save` method in `UserCreationForm` to include a call to `self.save_m2m()` when `commit=True`.
4. **Verify the Fix:** Rerun the reproduce script to ensure the `ManyToMany` field data is now saved correctly.
5. **Consider Edge Cases:** Ensure the fix handles various scenarios, such as empty `ManyToMany` fields, multiple `ManyToMany` fields, and forms used in different contexts.

### Solution Code

1. **Reproduce the Error Script (`reproduce_error.py`):**

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
from django.db import models

# Define a custom User model with a ManyToMany field
class CustomUser(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)

# Create a UserCreationForm for the custom User model
class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ['username', 'groups']

# Create a user using the form
form = CustomUserCreationForm(data={'username': 'testuser', 'groups': [1, 2]})
if form.is_valid():
    user = form.save(commit=True)
    # Check if groups are saved
    print(user.groups.all())
else:
    print(form.errors)
```

2. **Fix in `UserCreationForm` (`forms.py`):**

Locate the `save` method in `UserCreationForm` (typically in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`) and modify it to include `self.save_m2m()` when `commit=True`.

```python
def save(self, commit=True):
    user = super().save(commit=False)
    user.set_password(self.cleaned_data["password1"])
    if commit:
        user.save()
        # Call save_m2m to save ManyToMany fields
        self.save_m2m()
    return user
```

### Explanation

- **Reproduce the Error:** The script defines a custom User model with a `ManyToMany` field to `Group`. It creates a `UserCreationForm` for this model and attempts to save a user with groups assigned. If the groups are not saved, it confirms the issue.
  
- **Fix the Issue:** By adding `self.save_m2m()` in the `save` method of `UserCreationForm` when `commit=True`, we ensure that `ManyToMany` fields are saved along with the user.

- **Verify the Fix:** Running the reproduce script again should now show that the groups are correctly assigned to the user.

- **Edge Cases:** The fix should handle various edge cases, such as empty `ManyToMany` fields and multiple `ManyToMany` fields, without introducing new issues, as it aligns with the standard behavior of `ModelForm`.
