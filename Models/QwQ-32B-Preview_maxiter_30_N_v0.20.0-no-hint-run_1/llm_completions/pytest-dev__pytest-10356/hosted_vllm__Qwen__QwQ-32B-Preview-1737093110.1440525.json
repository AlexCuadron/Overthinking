Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue in the pytest repository related to how marks are handled when classes inherit from multiple base classes. The problem is that when a class inherits from two base classes, each marked with different pytest marks, only one of the marks is applied to the test methods in the derived class, depending on the method resolution order (MRO). The goal is to make sure that all marks from the base classes are combined and applied to the test methods in the derived class.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current behavior and confirm the issue by reproducing it with a test script. Then, I'll need to identify where in the pytest codebase this behavior is determined and make the necessary changes to ensure that marks from all base classes are collected and applied.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nI should start by getting familiar with the structure of the pytest repository.

This behavior is present in pytest 3-6, and I think it may as well have been intended. I am still filing it as a bug because I am not sure if this edge case was ever explicitly considered.\r\n\r\nIf it is widely understood that all markers are part of a single attribute, I guess you could say that this is just expected behavior as per MRO. However, I'd argue that it would be more intuitive to attempt to merge marker values into one, possibly deduplicating marker names by MRO.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport itertools\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nclass BaseMeta(type):\r\n    @property\r\n    def pytestmark(self):\r\n        return (\r\n            getattr(self, \"_pytestmark\", []) +\r\n            list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(getattr(x, \"_pytestmark\", []) for x in self.__mro__))\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    @pytestmark.setter\r\n    def pytestmark(self, value):\r\n        self._pytestmark = value\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Base(object):\r\n    # Without this metaclass, foo and bar markers override each other, and test_dings\r\n    # will only have one marker\r\n    # With the metaclass, test_dings will have both\r\n    __metaclass__ = BaseMeta\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.foo\r\nclass Foo(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.bar\r\nclass Bar(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass TestDings(Foo, Bar):\r\n    def test_dings(self):\r\n        # This test should have both markers, foo and bar.\r\n        # In practice markers are resolved using MRO (so foo wins), unless the\r\n        # metaclass is applied\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect `foo` and `bar` to be markers for `test_dings`, but this only actually is the case with this metaclass.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the repro case is Python 2/3 compatible excluding how metaclasses are added to `Base` (this needs to be taken care of to repro this issue on pytest 6)\nFix missing marks when inheritance from multiple classes\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is a quick checklist that should be present in PRs.\r\n\r\n- [] Include documentation when adding new features.\r\n- [ ] Include new tests or update existing tests when applicable.\r\n- [X] Allow maintainers to push and squash when merging my commits.

The problem is that when a class inherits from two base classes, each marked with different pytest marks, only one of the marks is applied to the test methods in the derived class, depending on the method resolution order (MRO). The goal is to make sure that all marks from the base classes are combined and applied to the test methods in the derived class.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current behavior and confirm the issue by reproducing it with a test script. Then, I'll need to identify where in the pytest codebase this behavior is determined and make the necessary changes to ensure that marks from all base classes are collected and applied.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Repository\n\nI should start by getting familiar with the structure of the pytest repository.
