INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls


Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__4.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__4.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Squashed migration is not marked as unapplied
Description
	 
		(last modified by Markus Holtermann)
	 
When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems that the script ran without any errors. This suggests that the issue might not be as straightforward as initially thought. Let's take a closer look at the code and the migration system to understand the problem better.

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that when a squashed migration is unapplied, only the replaced migrations are marked as unapplied, and the squashed migration itself remains marked as applied. This requires modifying the `MigrationExecutor` class in Django.

Let's start by editing the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file to make the necessary changes.

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/db/migrations/executor.py</parameter>

    # Custom logic to handle unapplying squashed migrations
    pass</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
ERROR:
No replacement was performed, old_str `def unapply_migration(self, plan, plan_index, collect_sql=False):` did not appear verbatim in /workspace/django__django__4.0/django/db/migrations/executor.py.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems that the `old_str` did not match exactly in the file. Let's try to find the correct line and make the necessary changes.

First, let's view the content of the `executor.py` file to find the correct line.

LAST RESPONSE:
It seems that the `old_str` did not match exactly in the file. Let's try to find the correct line and make the necessary changes.

First, let's view the content of the `executor.py` file to find the correct line.
