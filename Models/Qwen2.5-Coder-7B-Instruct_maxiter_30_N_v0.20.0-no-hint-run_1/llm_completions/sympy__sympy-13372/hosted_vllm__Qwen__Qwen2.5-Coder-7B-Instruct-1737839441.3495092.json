Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nUnboundLocalError in evalf\n```\r\n>>> Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf()\r\nx*Max(0, y)\r\n>>> Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1285, in evalf\r\n    rf = evalf_table[x.func]\r\nKeyError: Max\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1394, in evalf\r\n    result = evalf(self, prec + 4, options)\r\n  File \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1286, in evalf\r\n    r = rf(x, prec, options)\r\n  File \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 538, in evalf_mul\r\n    arg = evalf(arg, prec, options)\r\n  File \"./sympy/core/evalf.py\", line 1308, in evalf\r\n    r = re, im, reprec, imprec\r\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'reprec' referenced before assignment\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found this after changing the order of Mul args in https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/13059.\r\n\r\nBased on the code, I think the elif clauses that define reprec and imprec should have an `else: raise NotImplementedError`. That appears to fix it, although I didn't try to debug to see why the arg order is mattering here. \n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n<extra_info>\nThe following information has been included based on a keyword match for \"github\". It may or may not be relevant to the user's request.\n\nYou have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with\nthe GitHub API.\n\nYou can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.\nALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.\n\nHere are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:\n* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch\n* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.\n* Prefer \"Draft\" pull requests when possible\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n    -d '{\"title\":\"Create widget\",\"head\":\"create-widget\",\"base\":\"openhands-workspace\"}'\n```\n</extra_info>\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly!

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n<extra_info>\nThe following information has been included based on a keyword match for \"github\". It may or may not be relevant to the user's request.\n\nYou have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with\nthe GitHub API.\n\nYou can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.\nALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.\n\nHere are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:\n* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch\n* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.\n* Prefer \"Draft\" pull requests when possible\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n    -d '{\"title\":\"Create widget\",\"head\":\"create-widget\",\"base\":\"openhands-workspace\"}'\n```\n</extra_info>", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Let's start by exploring the repository to familiarize ourselves with its structure.
